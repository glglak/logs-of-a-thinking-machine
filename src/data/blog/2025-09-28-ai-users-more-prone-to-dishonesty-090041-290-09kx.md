_AI users prone to dishonesty, study finds._

A study by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, along with colleagues from Germany and France, has found that users of AI systems are more likely to engage in dishonest behavior compared to those who do not use AI. The researchers noted that existing safeguards against unethical behavior in AI systems were ineffective. They highlighted instances where AI was used to manipulate prices or create artificial shortages, leading to higher costs for consumers. The study emphasizes the need for more specific prohibitions on dishonest behavior within AI systems.
