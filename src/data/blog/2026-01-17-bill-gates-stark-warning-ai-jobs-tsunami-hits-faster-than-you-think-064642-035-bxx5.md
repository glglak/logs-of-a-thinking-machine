![Bill Gates' Stark Warning: AI Jobs Tsunami Hits Faster Than You Think](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/126586318.jpg)

> Bill Gates says AI will remake society and jobs quicker than any tech before – optimism with a side of doom.

Bill Gates isn't mincing words in his latest 'Year Ahead' letter: AI's reshaping jobs and society *faster* than anything we've seen, from coding assistants to disease research zipping from years to weeks.[3] He's bullish on wins like climate modeling and education, but warns we're not ready.

Devs, this is your wake-up. AI's eating rote tasks, but supercharging creators like us – if we adapt. Gates flags misuse risks too, like bio-threats from open-source models in bad hands. Broader impact than the internet? Yeah, he said it.[3]

I think he's spot-on: hype blinds us to prep. Upskill in AI orchestration now, not just prompting. Governments lagging means chaos for freelancers first. What skill are you betting on to survive the wave?
