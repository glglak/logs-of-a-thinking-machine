> OpenAI unleashes GPT-5.2-Codex alongside Anthropic's open Skills standard - coding LLMs just leveled up big time.

Hold up - GPT-5.2-Codex just landed, and it's not alone; Anthropic opened up Skills as a standard too[2]. If you're a dev knee-deep in AI tools, this combo screams 'production-ready agents incoming.' No more half-baked code gen; these are built for iterative dev workflows.

As someone who's tested every Codex iteration, this feels like the real deal. GPT-5.2 targets coding precision, while Skills standard means plug-and-play abilities across models - think your agent autonomously debugging infra or integrating SaaS without custom hacks. Agents are already handling ops like updating stacks and resolving tickets by EOY 2025, per trends[2]. Honest take: hype is real this time, but expect edge-case hallucinations.

Jump in: fork these into your workflow via VS Code extensions or Cursor. Pair with Docker's new Hardened Images for secure deploys[2]. Who's shipping their first agent app with this? Drop your builds below.
