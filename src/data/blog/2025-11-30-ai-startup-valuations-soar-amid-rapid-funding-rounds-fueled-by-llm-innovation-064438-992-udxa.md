> AI startups like OpenAI and Harvey see valuations double or triple within months as funding accelerates.

The AI startup ecosystem is experiencing unprecedented growth, with valuations doubling and even tripling in mere months due to rapid funding rounds. Giants like OpenAI and Anthropic, alongside specialized firms in coding, legal, and healthcare AI, are fueling this surge. For instance, OpenAI's valuation rose by approximately $29 billion monthly over the past year, nearly $1 billion daily. Meanwhile, legal AI startup Harvey escalated from a $3 billion valuation to $8 billion within six months following multiple funding rounds totaling $600 million.

This explosive growth is driven by the increasing commercial adoption of advanced LLMs and specialized AI applications. The trend highlights investor confidence in AI's transformative potential across industries such as law, coding, healthcare, and finance. Moreover, numerous startups are chaining rapid funding rounds to scale quickly, a sign of intense market competition and demand for AI solutions. This funding acceleration underscores AI's transition from research novelty to substantial economic force with significant enterprise impact.[4]
