> AWS and HUMAIN partner with NVIDIA to deploy 150,000 AI accelerators and launch a new AI Zone in Saudi Arabia.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and HUMAIN have announced a major expansion of their partnership, integrating NVIDIA's latest GB300 AI infrastructure and AWS's Trainium chips. The collaboration will deploy up to 150,000 AI accelerators, supporting a broad range of compute-intensive AI workloads, including model training and inference. This initiative will power the first-of-its-kind AI Zone in Saudi Arabia, designed to serve both national priorities and global demand for AI compute.

The AI Zone will enable enterprises and innovators worldwide to rapidly move from concept to production, leveraging seamless integration between NVIDIA's AI software and AWS's infrastructure. Customers will gain access to leading foundation models through Amazon Bedrock, Amazon AgentCore, and Amazon SageMaker, all abstracted from underlying hardware management. According to HUMAIN CEO Tareq Amin, this partnership marks the beginning of a multi-gigawatt journey, with a shared commitment to global market expansion and responsible AI deployment. The ecosystem aims to shape the future of how AI ideas are built, deployed, and scaled globally.
