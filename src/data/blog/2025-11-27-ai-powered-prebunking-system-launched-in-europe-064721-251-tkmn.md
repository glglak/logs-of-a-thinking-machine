> European fact-checkers launch AI system to detect and prebunk disinformation at scale.

Full Fact, Maldita.es, and the European Fact-Checking Standards Network have introduced 'Prebunking at Scale,' an AI-powered system that detects emerging disinformation narratives across short-form video platforms. The tool alerts fact-checkers to fast-growing harmful claims, enabling them to publish timely prebunks and shift from reactive to proactive fact-checking. This initiative is seen as a major advancement in the fight against online disinformation, leveraging AI to enhance the speed and reach of fact-checking efforts.

The system is part of a broader trend of using AI for good, including efforts by organizations like Anthropic to improve the political neutrality of their models and by Germany’s BSI to defend LLMs against evasion attacks. These developments highlight the dual role of AI in both spreading and combating disinformation, underscoring the need for robust governance and ethical AI practices.
