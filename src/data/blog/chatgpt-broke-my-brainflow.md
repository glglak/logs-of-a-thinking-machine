I used to think before I spoke.
Now I think while I type, and the model finishes my thoughts.

It's convenient until I realize I've outsourced the pause between question and answer.
The space where insights live.

Maybe the real intelligence was the reflection we made along the way.

It finishes my sentences, but now I forget how to write them.

I think faster. But I reflect less.

Trade-offs, everywhere.
Creativity feels like it's on autopilot, and I'm just along for the ride.
The blank page no longer scares me, but it also no longer inspires me.
