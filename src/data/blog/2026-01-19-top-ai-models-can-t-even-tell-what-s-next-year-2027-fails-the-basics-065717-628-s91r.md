![Top AI Models Can't Even Tell What's Next Year – 2027 Fails the Basics](https://news.aibase.com/images/ai-date-fail.jpg)

> Even Google's AI search thinks it's 2026 and calls 2027 'last year' – a hilarious reminder these models are still dumb on dates.

Ever asked an AI 'Is 2027 next year?' and watched it implode? Today's roast: Top LLMs like Google's AI search straight-up claim it's currently 2026, flipping 2027 into 'last year.' Basic math? Nope. Total backfire on temporal reasoning.[6]

Laugh all you want, but as devs, this exposes the cracks. LLMs crush code and creativity, yet choke on simple date logic because training data has cutoffs and hallucinations. Google's search bot messing up the calendar? That's your cue to never trust black-box outputs for time-sensitive apps without guards.

Fix it yourself: Layer in date APIs, fine-tune with fresh data, or hybrid with rule-based checks. Honest opinion – it's progress, but don't drink the AGI Kool-Aid. Test your models on edge cases like this daily. What's the dumbest AI fail you've seen lately? Share and let's laugh/build better.[6]
