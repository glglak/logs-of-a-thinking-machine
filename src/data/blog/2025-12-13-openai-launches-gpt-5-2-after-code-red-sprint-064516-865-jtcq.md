> OpenAI releases GPT-5.2 with enhanced reasoning, coding, and long prompts after internal 'code red' to counter Google's Gemini 3. Now in ChatGPT for paying users.

OpenAI rolled out GPT-5.2 on December 11, 2025, featuring improvements in reasoning, coding capabilities, and handling longer prompts. CEO Sam Altman initiated a 'code red' development sprint to accelerate the release following Google's Gemini 3 debut in November, which had less impact than feared but prompted OpenAI to prioritize core model quality.

The model delivers greater economic value through tasks like generating spreadsheets and multi-step plans, starting with availability in ChatGPT for paying users. This move underscores intensifying competition among leading AI labs, where rapid iterations aim to maintain edges in flagship products amid rivalry.
