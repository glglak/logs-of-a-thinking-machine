_OpenAI launches Sora 2 for improved video generation._

OpenAI has introduced Sora 2, a next-generation video generation model designed to enhance physical realism, provide finer detail, and offer greater control. This development marks a significant step forward in video generation capabilities, allowing for more sophisticated and realistic content creation. Sora 2 is part of OpenAI's ongoing efforts to push the boundaries of AI-driven media creation. The model is expected to support a wide range of applications, from entertainment to educational content, by offering more convincing visual effects and detailed imagery.
