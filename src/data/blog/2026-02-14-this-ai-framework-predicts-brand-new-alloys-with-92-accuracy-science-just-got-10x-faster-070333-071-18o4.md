> JAIST's new AI fuses expert knowledge from papers into a framework that discovers high-entropy alloys even for unseen elements.

**Tired of sifting decades of scattered papers for your next battery breakthrough?** A JAIST team just dropped an AI framework that extracts cross-disciplinary knowledge and fuses it with data to predict alloys with scary accuracy.[2]

Led by Prof. Hieu-Chi Dam, the system uses LLMs to mine expert insights from literature, combines them via evidence fusion, and outperforms standard ML—hitting 86-92% accuracy on unseen elements where training data lacks them.[2] It validated against 55 real quaternary alloys, beating compute-heavy free-energy models, and spits out uncertainty maps to guide experiments.[2]

Developers in materials sci, pharma, or energy: plug this into your workflows to prioritize synths, cut lab time, and scale discoveries in batteries, catalysts, or drugs. Open the black box of interdisciplinary data silos.[2]

Unlike pure sims (DFT) or narrow ML, this hybrid leverages 'dispersed expert knowledge' across fields, generalizing to zero-shot elements—think LlamaIndex for science lit but with fusion for predictions.[2] MIT's Gómez-Bombarelli echoes this for materials AI inflection.[1][2]

**Download the code from JAIST's repo (check arXiv preprint), run on your alloy datasets—what material will you reinvent first?** This could halve R&D cycles; track drug/battery apps next.[2]
