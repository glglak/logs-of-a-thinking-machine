title: Abstractions Are a Scam
description: We claim to simplify, but complexity just hides behind APIs.

We don’t remove complexity. We just move it.
Put it behind a pretty API and call it simplicity.
Until someone needs to debug it.

Then it’s all turtles.
The layers keep stacking until no one remembers the bottom.
Each new abstraction is a smaller box inside a bigger one.
Eventually we forget which box does what.
