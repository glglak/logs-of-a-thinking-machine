> Google launches biggest AI hardware engineering center outside US in Taipei, boosting AI infrastructure and innovation.

Google has inaugurated its largest AI infrastructure hardware engineering center outside the United States, located in Taipei, Taiwan. This new multidisciplinary hub will house hundreds of engineers working to accelerate AI innovation and hardware development. Google's strategy leverages Taiwan’s advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem, with proximity to chip fabs giving the company a strategic advantage in developing and deploying cutting-edge AI hardware. The Taipei center is more than a local engineering site; it is positioned as a global node where innovations will be integrated into Google's worldwide data center network, enhancing services such as Google Search, YouTube, and AI-driven features powered by the company's flagship AI model. This move reflects a broader trend among American tech giants to regionalize AI infrastructure development closer to manufacturing hubs, rather than concentrating all operations in Silicon Valley. Google's investment includes expanding its data center presence in Asia Pacific and laying international subsea cables, fortifying Taiwan as a critical link in global AI data flow. Recruiting efforts for hardware engineers and specialists are underway, emphasizing the company's commitment to embedding AI hardware leadership within the Asian technology ecosystem.[3]
