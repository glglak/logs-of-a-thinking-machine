![C3.ai Just Posted a Revenue Rebound - But That Cash Burn Is Terrifying](https://www.ainvest.com/images/c3ai-revenue-rebound.jpg)

> Subscription revenue jumped 16.5% thanks to Microsoft and AWS - is enterprise AI finally taking off?

Hold up - C3.ai, the enterprise AI player that's been struggling, just dropped Q2 numbers showing a revenue rebound to $75.1M. As a dev who's built AI pipelines for big corps, this hits different because their subscription growth spiked 16.5% QoQ, fueled by massive partnerships with Microsoft and AWS that drove 89% of bookings.[1]

Why does this matter to you? If you're shipping AI apps, C3.ai's pivot from experimentation to full deployment signals enterprises are finally ready to pay for scalable AI. But here's the red flag: they're burning cash hard with a $42.2M operating loss despite $675M in reserves. New CEO's got work to do on profitability.[1]

My take? Bullish on the partnerships proving cloud giants are the real AI gatekeepers, but watch that burn rate - one slip and it's game over. Devs, are you integrating C3.ai tools yet, or sticking to open-source?
