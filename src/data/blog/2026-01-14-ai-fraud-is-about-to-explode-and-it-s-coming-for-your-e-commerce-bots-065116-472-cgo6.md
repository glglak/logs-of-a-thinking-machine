> $12.5B in losses last year? Experian's warning says AI agents will turn shopping into a fraud apocalypse in 2026.

Picture this: Your AI shopping agent zips through checkout like a pro, but it's secretly a deepfake scammer draining accounts. Experian's 2026 Fraud Forecast dropped today, predicting a 'tipping point' with machine-to-machine chaos where bad bots masquerade as good ones from OpenAI or Perplexity[2]. Amazon's already suing to block rogue agents—your site's next if you're not ready.

Devs, this matters because we're building these agents everywhere, but distinguishing malicious from legit traffic is now table stakes. Smart homes, cloned sites, and emotionally savvy romance bots are ramping up, all powered by democratized AI tools that fraudsters wield like candy[2]. Experian's CIO nails it: It's not 'block all bots,' it's 'is this a good bot or malware?'.

Honest opinion: Hype around agentic AI ignores this dark side, but it's fixable with better bot vetting and behavioral analytics. If you're in e-comm or fintech, audit your APIs now—don't wait for the $12.5B loss repeat. How's your fraud detection holding up against GenAI tricks?
