> KAIST tech turns personal GPUs into AI beasts, cutting service costs by 67%—bye-bye AWS dependency.

Tired of AI inference draining your wallet? KAIST just dropped tech that hacks personal GPUs to run services 67% cheaper. No more begging data centers—your rig becomes the cloud.[6]

For devs, this is liberation: scale AI without hyperscaler lock-in. Published today, it optimizes consumer hardware for pro workloads, perfect for prototyping agents or fine-tuning on the cheap. In a world of exploding compute costs, this levels the indie dev playing field against Big Tech.[6]

I love it—practical, local-first AI without vaporware promises. Pair it with open models like DeepSeek, and you're golden. Limitations? Probably needs beefy GPUs, but still. Who's benchmarking this on their home setup? Share results!
