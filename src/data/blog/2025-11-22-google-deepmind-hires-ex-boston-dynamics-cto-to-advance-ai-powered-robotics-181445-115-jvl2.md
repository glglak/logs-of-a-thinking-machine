> DeepMind recruits robotics expert to build Gemini-based AI OS for diverse robot platforms.

In a strategic move to deepen its robotics capabilities, Google DeepMind has hired the former CTO of Boston Dynamics, signaling significant investment in integrating advanced AI with robotics. CEO Demis Hassabis highlighted that their vision for the Gemini AI platform is to create a universal robot operating system that can be deployed across various robotic bodies with minimal customization.

The goal is to extend Gemini’s application beyond software and knowledge work into the physical world, allowing robots to operate 'out-of-the-box' across diverse configurations. This development could accelerate progress in autonomous robotics, enabling applications ranging from industrial automation to service robotics. The hiring underscores the convergence of LLM advances and robotic autonomy, suggesting upcoming breakthroughs in real-world AI applications and embodied intelligence[2].
