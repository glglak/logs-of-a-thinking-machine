> GPT-5.1 & Google's SIMA 2 mark shift toward autonomous AI agents excelling in reasoning & multi-modal tasks.

OpenAI launched GPT-5.1 in two variants, significantly enhancing reasoning capabilities, while Baidu introduced ERNIE 5.0, an omni-modal model excelling in text, images, and video understanding, outperforming GPT-4o on multilingual video tasks using its own Kunlun chips. Google DeepMind revealed SIMA 2, a 3D game-playing AI agent that uses Gemini for language, planning, and precise control, capable of self-improvement through reinforcement learning and generalizing to new environments, showing a tenfold improvement on long-horizon tasks compared to its predecessor. These advances signal a key shift from chatbots to autonomous reasoning agents capable of long-term planning and action, critical for real-world robotics and autonomous software engineering. Despite strides, interpretability remains a challenge, with 42% of AI code still failing unpredictably. This evolution is expected to accelerate industrial AI applications and enterprise adoption, laying groundwork for factory robots and autonomous AI engineers.
