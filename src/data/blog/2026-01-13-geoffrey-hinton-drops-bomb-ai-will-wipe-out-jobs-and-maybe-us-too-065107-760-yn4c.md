> The Godfather of AI warns of massive unemployment and existential risks – time to future-proof your dev career?

Geoffrey Hinton, the dude who basically invented modern neural nets, just went full doomsayer: AI's causing massive unemployment, soaring hyperscaler profits, and a 10-20% shot at human extinction. No sugarcoating – he trashes UBI as a dignity killer and calls out weak regs under Trump while China's ahead.

For devs, this isn't abstract: agentic AI could automate coding jobs faster than you think, shifting us to AI orchestration and ethics roles. Hinton uses ChatGPT daily for research (even exes roast him with it), proving it's already reshaping workflows. Upside? Immense tools for bioweapon defense or breakthroughs we can't imagine.

My hot take: Don't panic-sell your skills; double down on AI literacy. Build agents, not just apps – it's survival of the augmented. Devs, what's your plan B if Hinton's right?
