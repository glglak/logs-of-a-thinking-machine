> AWS and HUMAIN partner to deploy up to 150,000 AI accelerators, including NVIDIA GB300 and AWS Trainium, in Saudi Arabia's first AI Zone.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and HUMAIN have announced a major expansion of their partnership, deploying up to 150,000 AI accelerators—featuring the latest NVIDIA GB300 AI infrastructure and AWS's Trainium chips—in Saudi Arabia. This initiative creates the first-of-its-kind AI Zone, designed to support cutting-edge AI training and inference workloads for both national and global enterprises. The zone will enable rapid deployment of AI applications, leveraging advanced hardware and seamless integration with AWS services like Amazon Bedrock, AgentCore, and SageMaker.

The collaboration positions AWS as HUMAIN's preferred AI partner worldwide, aiming to meet the surging global demand for AI compute. Amazon Bedrock will allow customers to access leading foundation models without managing underlying infrastructure, streamlining the development and scaling of AI solutions. According to HUMAIN CEO Tareq Amin, the project marks the beginning of a multi-gigawatt journey, engineered to serve both Saudi Arabia's national AI ambitions and the broader international market. The partnership is notable for its scale, innovative commercial model, and commitment to global expansion, setting a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and ecosystem development.
