> Gigabyte goes all-in on AI Factory, Physical AI, and Agentic solutions at CES – this is the hardware devs need for real-world AI agents.

CES 2026 kicked off with Gigabyte declaring they're 'AI Forward,' unveiling AI Factory setups, Physical AI, and Agentic AI solutions that bridge the gap from hype to hardware reality. If you've been waiting for gear that turns LLMs into tangible, agentic systems that interact with the physical world, this is it – think factories humming with AI orchestration.[1]

For developers, this matters because Agentic AI isn't just buzz; it's about scalable factories where AI agents handle complex workflows autonomously. Physical AI takes it further, embedding smarts into hardware for robotics and beyond. Gigabyte's not playing small – full ecosystem showcase means plug-and-play for your next project, whether it's industrial automation or edge inference.[1]

My hot take: While software LLMs steal headlines, hardware like this will make or break AI adoption in production. It's practical gold for devs tired of cloud bills – build local AI factories that scale. Are you ready to agent-ify your stack, or still stuck in prompt engineering?[1]
