> A 3B param beast running 50 tokens/sec locally that beats 70B models on coding benchmarks.

I just downloaded this open-source monster called NanoCode-3B and holy crap, it's rewriting my local dev workflow. Trained on 10T tokens of GitHub + StackOverflow, it's spitting out production-ready Python faster than I can review it. And it runs buttery smooth on my M2 MacBook - no GPU needed.

Why does this matter to you? Because fat cloud APIs are yesterday's news. This thing scores 82% on HumanEval (Llama-4-70B is at 79%) while sipping 4GB RAM. For indie devs, side projects, or air-gapped enterprise, it's freedom. No $0.02/token bills, no data privacy nightmares. I prototyped a full Flask API in 20 minutes - cleaner than anything Copilot's given me.

The catch? It's specialized for code, so don't ask it to write poetry. But for building apps? This is the Vercel of local models. Download it today and kiss your API keys goodbye.

Who's switching their editor setup first?
