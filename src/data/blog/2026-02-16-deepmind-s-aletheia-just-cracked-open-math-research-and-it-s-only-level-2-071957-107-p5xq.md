> DeepMind's new agent autonomously wrote a math paper and solved Erdős conjectures – is this the dawn of AI mathematicians?

**Imagine an AI that doesn't just solve math problems – it generates original research papers and tackles unsolved conjectures on its own.** That's no longer sci-fi: Google DeepMind just dropped Aletheia, and it's rewriting what we thought LLMs could do in pure mathematics.[1]

Aletheia runs on an advanced Gemini Deep Think model with a 'Generator-Verifier-Reviser' agentic loop. It spits out proofs in natural language, checks them internally for hallucinations, revises, and iterates until solid. Benchmarks? 95.1% accuracy on the IMO-Proof Bench. Real wins: it autonomously generated a full paper on 'eigenweights' in arithmetic geometry (cited as Feng26) and solved four open problems from the Erdős Conjectures database.[1]

For developers building agentic systems, this is gold. Aletheia's self-verification tackles the hallucination nightmare in long-chain reasoning – think RAG pipelines for technical docs or code review agents that catch their own bugs. It's a blueprint for reliable math-heavy apps like theorem provers, scientific simulators, or even fintech risk models.[1]

Compare to prior art: Lean/Coq assistants top out at guided proofs; AlphaProof hit competition-level but not autonomous research. Aletheia introduces DeepMind's 'Autonomous Mathematics Research Level' taxonomy – it's at Level 2 (Publication Grade) but needs Level 4 for Wiles-level breakthroughs. Chinese models and OpenAI's o1 are nipping at heels, but this sets the bar.[1]

**Fire it up:** DeepMind shared the framework paper – fork it on GitHub, plug into your Gemini API quota, and test on your own proofs. Watch for Level 3 agent swarms next. Question is: when does math research become a solved problem?
