> Kimi K2.5 unleashes ~100 sub-agents per task—your single-model bottlenecks are over.

Single LLMs choking on multi-step jobs? Kimi's K2.5 flips the script with **Agent Swarm**: up to **100 AI sub-agents** collaborating on one task, dividing labor for blistering speed.[2][3]

Launched this week, it lets sub-agents tackle subtasks in parallel—research says this crushes monolithic agents, with Kimi hitting **50.2% on HLE benchmarks** (highest reported with tools). Perfect for devs building production agents without the coordination headache.[3]

This slots right into your workflow: automate CI/CD pipelines, debug sprawling codebases, or orchestrate RAG over massive docs. No more waiting on one model to chain-think; swarms scale complexity linearly with agents.

Versus solo models like GLM-5 (agent-strong but single-threaded) or OLMo 3, Swarm's parallelism echoes multi-agent trends but with real speedups. Watch rivals like DeepSeek distill this too—ecosystem shifting to swarms fast.[2][4]

Try Kimi K2.5 now via their platform; prototype a swarm for your next project. Will 100 agents become the new baseline, or just hype?
