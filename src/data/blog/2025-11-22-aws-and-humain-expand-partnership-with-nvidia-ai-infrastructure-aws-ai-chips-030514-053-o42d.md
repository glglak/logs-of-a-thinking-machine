> AWS and HUMAIN scale up AI with 150,000 NVIDIA GB300s and Trainium chips in Saudi Arabia’s new AI Zone.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Saudi-based HUMAIN have announced an expanded partnership featuring deployment of up to 150,000 AI accelerators, including the latest NVIDIA GB300 AI infrastructure and AWS’s Trainium chips. This collaboration establishes an AI Zone in Saudi Arabia designed to handle advanced AI training and inference workloads. The co-developed AI infrastructure supports rapid movement of AI concepts from conception to production, facilitating diverse compute-intensive applications. Through Amazon Bedrock and other generative AI services like Amazon SageMaker and AgentCore, customers can access top-tier foundation models optimized for this hardware, abstracting away infrastructure complexity. AWS is now HUMAIN's preferred global AI partner, collaborating to bring innovative AI cloud compute and services worldwide. The AI Zone is intended to meet both Saudi Arabia’s AI strategic goals and the surging global demand for high-performance AI compute, reflecting a landmark public-private initiative to accelerate AI development with specialized infrastructure.
