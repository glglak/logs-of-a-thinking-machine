> AI hype ran Wall Street up — now the hangover is here, and it’s asking whether all this AI cash actually buys real products.

Hot take: the AI market’s mood flipped from ‘inevitable growth’ to ‘prove it’ in a single trading session. The market slid yesterday as heavyweights tied to AI—Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and even specialist cloud players—took meaningful hits, dragging major indexes down and exposing how concentrated investor bets were on AI narratives rather than demonstrated revenue streams (and debt loads) from those projects[1].

Why this matters to you as a developer: funding and stock enthusiasm shape hiring, tooling investments, and which cloud credits or hardware discounts stay available. When investors demand proof of monetization, companies pause or pivot projects, freeze hiring, or tighten budgets — all things that directly slow down product teams and researchers who rely on steady resources[1].

Practical implications: if your team depends on a vendor’s generous trial credits, GPU promos, or a steady pipeline for ML ops services, plan for scenarios where that support shrinks; focus on cost-efficient models, open-source runtimes, and measurable KPIs that show ROI from your AI features. My honest opinion: the market correction is overdue and healthy — it will weed out vaporware and force more pragmatic engineering choices, even if that’s painful short term.

Are you prepared to prove your model’s value beyond flashy demos?
