> Fujitsu and AWS Japan start a lab to drive retail and service industry innovation with generative AI by 2026.

Fujitsu, in collaboration with Amazon Web Services Japan, has launched a business creation lab aimed at accelerating transformation in the retail and service sectors through generative AI and cloud technologies. The lab provides end-to-end support—from diagnosing operational challenges to rapid proof of concept and implementation—targeting measurable improvements in key performance indicators within 90 days. Initially focusing on food distribution, the initiative plans to extend to other Japanese industries by leveraging AWS’s cloud infrastructure and foster cross-industry data collaboration.

Customers like Mitsubishi Shokuhin utilize this partnership to standardize expert knowledge via generative AI chatbots, enabling automation and acceleration of manual processes. This project exemplifies knowledge transfer and operational stability improvements while setting the foundation for advanced AI applications such as system trouble prevention. The collaboration underscores a shared commitment to co-creating new value and sustainable growth through innovative AI-driven business practices.
