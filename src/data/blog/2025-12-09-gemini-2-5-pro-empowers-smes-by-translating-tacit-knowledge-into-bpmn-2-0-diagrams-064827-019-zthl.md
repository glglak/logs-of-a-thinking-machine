> Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM captures SMEs' tacit knowledge and converts it into BPMN 2.0 process diagrams for better business workflows.

The conversational assistant powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro large language model marks a significant advance in business process management by effectively capturing tacit knowledge held by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Tacit knowledge, often unwritten and experience-based, is difficult to document but essential for operational excellence. Gemini 2.5 Pro harnesses advanced LLM capabilities to translate this implicit expertise into explicit BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams, a standardized way to represent workflows.
This transformation facilitates improved process understanding, documentation, and optimization without extensive manual effort by SMEs, which often lack dedicated process engineering resources. By integrating conversational AI with LLM-driven knowledge extraction, this approach helps to democratize access to sophisticated business process modeling. It also enables more efficient training, onboarding, and consistency across teams, ultimately driving digital transformation in smaller enterprises that historically face challenges adopting advanced AI tools due to resource constraints.
