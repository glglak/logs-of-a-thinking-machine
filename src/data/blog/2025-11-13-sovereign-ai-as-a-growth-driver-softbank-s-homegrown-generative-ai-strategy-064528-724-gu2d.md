> SoftBank details its homegrown LLM strategy, including 'Sarashina mini' and plans for a trillion-parameter model.

SoftBank is advancing its sovereign AI strategy by developing homegrown large language models, led by its subsidiary SB Intuitions Corp. The company has optimized 'Sarashina mini,' a distilled model balancing speed, accuracy, and cost, to meet diverse enterprise needs while preserving high performance. This model is not only a standalone solution but also a building block for future AI development.



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
