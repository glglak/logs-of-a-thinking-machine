> OpenAI just made GPT-5.2 a free scientific word processor - scientists, say goodbye to writer's block forever.

**Research papers taking weeks to write? OpenAI's new tool turns GPT-5.2 into your personal science co-pilot, free for any ChatGPT user.**

OpenAI launched Prism, a free web-based scientific workspace built on GPT-5.2. It functions like an AI-native word processor tailored for research: draft papers, review literature, reason through hypotheses, and iterate experiments - all without replacing human expertise. Available instantly to anyone with a ChatGPT account, it's positioned as a game-changer for scientific productivity.[4]

For developers building research tools or scientists coding analyses, Prism streamlines the entire workflow. No more context-switching between docs, notebooks, and chatbots - everything lives in one intelligent canvas. It accelerates paper writing, hypothesis testing, and peer review prep, potentially cutting research cycles from months to days.[4]

Unlike general tools like NotebookLM or Claude Projects, Prism is specialized for science with GPT-5.2's superior reasoning. It competes with arXiv-powered agents but adds real-time collaboration and free access, challenging paid platforms like Elicit or Consensus.[4]

Sign in with ChatGPT now and upload your next paper draft. Watch how it handles citations, suggests experiments, and debugs methods. Could this make solo researchers as productive as big labs? Test it before your competitors do.
