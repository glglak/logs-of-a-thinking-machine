> Grok 3 just silver-medaled an IMO qualifier while being open and free - OpenAI who?

Boom - xAI's Grok 3 just flexed by scoring silver on International Math Olympiad qualifiers, something no LLM has touched before. And get this: it's dropping as a free, open-weight model you can run locally. In a world of $20/month subscriptions, this is the rebel yell developers needed.

As someone who's tired of black-box APIs, I love that Grok 3 prioritizes reasoning over fluff. It nailed geometry proofs and algebra that trip up Claude and GPT. Practical win? Use it for automated theorem proving in your scientific computing or game AI projects - no cloud dependency.

Skeptical? Early evals show it's not hallucinating as much on edge cases. Download it tonight and benchmark against Llama. Is this the open model that finally beats the giants? What's your first test case gonna be?
