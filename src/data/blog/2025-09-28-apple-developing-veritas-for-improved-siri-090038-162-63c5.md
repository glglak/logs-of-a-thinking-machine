_Apple tests 'Veritas' to enhance Siri with AI features._

Apple is reportedly developing 'Veritas,' a standalone app-like interface designed to improve Siri through advanced AI capabilities. Veritas is testing features such as AI-powered personal data searches and photo editing, which could be integrated into future Siri updates. This development is part of Apple's efforts to enhance user experience with AI-driven tools. The new Siri version is expected to be released in March 2026, following the iPhone 17 series launch in September 2025.
