Every day at 9AM, we begin the same loop.
- Condition: not all team members have spoken
- Output: mostly status noise
- Action: none

Just a while-loop with no break statement.
Occasionally someone times out, but the loop continues.
We call it alignment but rarely align.
It runs until morale hits zero.
