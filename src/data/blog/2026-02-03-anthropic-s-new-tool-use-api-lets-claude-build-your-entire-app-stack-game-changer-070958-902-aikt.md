![Anthropic's New Tool-Use API Lets Claude Build Your Entire App Stack - Game Changer](https://anthropic.com/tool-use-demo.gif)

> Claude's tool-use API dropped today - it now autonomously calls GitHub, Vercel, Postgres, and Stripe to ship full apps from one prompt.

Ever wished your LLM could just... build the thing? No more 'generate code then manually deploy' dance. Anthropic's tool-use API turns Claude into your full-stack dev ops team.

Live today: Claude 3.5 Sonnet with native function calling for 50+ tools - GitHub PRs, Vercel deploys, Supabase queries, Stripe charges, even browser automation. One prompt like 'Build and deploy a SaaS invoicing app with auth and payments' and it orchestrates the entire pipeline, testing as it goes. Latency under 800ms per tool call.

This rewires agentic workflows. Prototype MVPs in hours, not weeks. Non-dev PMs now ship code. Your AI coding agent finally escaped the sandbox into production reality.

Anthropic leapfrogs OpenAI's assistants (limited scopes) and LangChain hacks (brittle). Context window still king at 200k, but tools make it exponentially more capable than raw token generation.

API key at console.anthropic.com ($3/1M input). Test with their 'deploy-mern-stack' playground. Ship a real app today. Question is: how many dev jobs does this automate by Q4?
