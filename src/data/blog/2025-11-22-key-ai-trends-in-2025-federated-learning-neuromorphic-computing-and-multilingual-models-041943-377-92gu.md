> 2025 AI highlights: privacy-focused federated learning, brain-like neuromorphic chips, and advanced multilingual LLMs.

Emerging AI trends in 2025 include significant advances in federated learning, which enables privacy-preserving AI model training across decentralized data without sharing sensitive information. Cross-silo federated learning is gaining momentum, allowing multiple organizations to collaborate on AI development while maintaining data privacy, a critical evolution for regulated industries and collaborative AI applications.

Neuromorphic computing is progressing with sophisticated chips designed to mimic brain neural networks more closely, offering enhanced learning and reasoning capabilities modeled on human biology. This approach promises applications that think and learn more like humans.

Additionally, advancements in multilingual large language models (LLMs) are notable, with models now understanding and generating text in hundreds of languages with high proficiency. Zero-shot learning capabilities are also improving, allowing AI to perform tasks without prior task-specific training, effectively broadening AI applications to novel domains and queries without extensive labeled data.
