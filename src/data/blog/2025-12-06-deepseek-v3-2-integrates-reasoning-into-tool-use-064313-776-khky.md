> DeepSeek-V3.2, released December 1, 2025, thinks while using tools, enabling real-time error recovery in coding workflows.

DeepSeek AI’s newly released DeepSeek-V3.2 is generating significant buzz in the open-source community for its novel integration of reasoning directly into tool use. Unlike earlier models that separate planning from action, V3.2 maintains reasoning traces while executing API calls and terminal commands, allowing it to detect and recover from errors in real time. This tight coupling of thought and action makes it particularly powerful for complex coding tasks, debugging, and automated refactoring.
