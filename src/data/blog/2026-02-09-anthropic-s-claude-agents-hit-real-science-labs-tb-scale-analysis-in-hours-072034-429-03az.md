> Claude-powered multi-agent systems just deployed to Allen Institute: compressing months of genomics analysis into hours.

**Biology labs drown in terabyte datasets from single-cell sequencing and brain mapping. Claude agents now turn months into hours[2].**

Anthropic partnered with Allen Institute and HHMI (Feb 2), embedding Claude AI agents for multi-omic integration, knowledge graphs, and protein design. Specialized agents handle connectomics/imaging at scale, targeting 4-6 month bottlenecks down to days[2].

For bioinformaticians and computational biologists: this is production-ready agentic workflows for science. No more manual data wrangling – agents automate hypothesis gen, temporal modeling, neural discovery. Plus, Ai2's open-source **Theorizer** for falsifiable reasoning drops same day[2].

Existing tools (manual pipelines, basic Jupyter scripts) can't scale to TBs. Claude's multi-agent setup outperforms single-LLM analysis by parallelizing tasks. Competitive landscape: OpenAI/Groq agents lag in specialized science deploys; Anthropic leads institutional integration[2].

**Get started:** Check Theorizer on GitHub[2], follow Allen/HHMI for benchmarks. Integrate Claude API into your pipelines? If agents conquer science data, what's next for your domain?
