![MIT's Codon LLM Revolution: Design Better Proteins, Slash Drug Dev Costs](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1116762/protein-model.jpg)

> LLM for DNA codons optimizes protein production like never before – code dropped, ready for your biotech pipeline.

**Protein engineering costs millions and takes years. This MIT LLM does it in silico, for pennies.**

MIT researchers built an **encoder-decoder LLM** trained on DNA sequences that optimizes codon usage for max protein expression.[3] Targeting yeast (*K. phaffii*), it redesigned genes for human growth hormone, albumin, and cancer drug trastuzumab. The model learned biological rules autonomously—like avoiding inhibitory repeats and grouping amino acids by hydrophobicity.

**Why devs/biotech hackers care:** Open-source code available now. Plug your target protein, get optimized sequences for industrial yeast (used in 70% of protein therapeutics). Cuts development timelines from months to days, massive for therapeutics, enzymes, materials.

Beats rule-based codon optimization by capturing long-range DNA dependencies LLMs excel at. Species-specific (works on human/cow data too), unlike generic tools. Competitive edge over AlphaFold3's structure focus—this handles expression engineering.

**Action plan:** Grab the code from Love's lab GitHub. Test on your proteins of interest. Fine-tune for other organisms. Watch pharma giants adopt—could this make custom biologics as easy as API calls? Your move.
