> Modders cracked the RTX 5080 to bump 16GB VRAM to 32GB, turning gamer GPUs into AI beasts overnight.

RTX 5080 owners in China are living the dream—or nightmare. Modders figured out how to double VRAM from 16GB to 32GB, making these cards prime for AI training and inference[1]. No more memory bottlenecks for local LLMs or fine-tuning on consumer hardware.

Devs, this changes everything for AI workstations on a budget. Spin up Stable Diffusion, Llama runs, or custom models without cloud costs. But the downside? AI hoarders are snapping up gamer GPUs, driving prices sky-high and leaving frag fests empty. If you're rigging a home lab, hunt these mod kits now[1].

Truth bomb: Nvidia's gaming cards were always AI hybrids, but this hack accelerates the takeover. Practical move: Prioritize high-VRAM cards for dev rigs. Gamers vs. AI devs— who's winning your next build?
