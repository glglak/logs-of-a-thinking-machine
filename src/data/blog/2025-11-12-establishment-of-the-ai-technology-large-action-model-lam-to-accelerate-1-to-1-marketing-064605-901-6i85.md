> NTT introduces Large Action Model (LAM) for personalized marketing and time-series prediction.

NTT has developed the Large Action Model (LAM), a Transformer-based AI for time-series prediction that handles mixed numerical and categorical data, including missing or biased values. LAM distinguishes contextual differences in the order of customer actions, improving intent prediction and personalization in marketing. Innovations like a hierarchical Transformer structure enhance learning efficiency by aggregating data at different frequencies and formats. NTT is exploring applications in healthcare, such as supporting diabetes treatment by analyzing patient histories, and in energy, for forecasting solar radiation using meteorological data. The technology’s flexibility and cost-effectiveness suggest broad potential across domains.



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
