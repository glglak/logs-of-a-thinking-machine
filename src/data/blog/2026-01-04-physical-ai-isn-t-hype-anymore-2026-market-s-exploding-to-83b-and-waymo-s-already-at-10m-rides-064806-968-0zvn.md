![Physical AI Isn't Hype Anymore – 2026 Market's Exploding to $83B and Waymo's Already at 10M Rides](https://example.com/physical-ai.jpg)

> physical AI market hits $83B by 2035 with Waymo's 10M rides proving it's real – drones, robots, wearables go mainstream now.

Physical AI was prototype dreams yesterday; today's numbers scream production.[3] Gartner/Deloitte flag it as a top 2026 trend, with market blasting from $3.1B to $83.6B by 2035.[3] Waymo's 10M paid robotaxi rides and 100M miles? That's customer money, not demos.[3]

Devs, this means edge inference under 5W for always-on wearables and drones – Qualcomm/NVIDIA packing teraflops into tiny boards.[3] Practical: build fatigue-monitoring wearables cutting injuries 15%, or autonomous drones ditching remote controls. No more power-hungry lab rigs.

My take: 2026 flips Physical AI from 'cool if' to 'must-deploy.' Risks? Hype fatigue, but data says scale. Time to cert up and ship – robotics arms grasping smoothly, wearables sensing everywhere. Are you prepping your Physical AI stack for the surge?
