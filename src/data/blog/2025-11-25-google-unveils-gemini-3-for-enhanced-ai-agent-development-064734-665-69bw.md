> Google's Gemini 3 improves context understanding and rolls out agentic AI features across its platforms.

Google recently announced Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its large language model, which powers all of the company's AI features. Gemini 3 is designed to better understand the context and intent behind user requests, reducing the need for multiple prompts to achieve desired results. The model is now the default for AI Mode, the Gemini app, AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Google Antigravity, marking a shift from previous releases where Google waited before making the newest model the default. Gemini is also being integrated into Android Auto, replacing Google Assistant with a more conversational AI model.

Gemini 3 introduces new AI-powered features in Google Search, such as a Canvas tool for building detailed itineraries based on personalized prompts, a global rollout of Flight Deals, and AI-powered agentic booking for restaurant reservations and potentially hotels in the near future. These updates highlight Google's focus on distribution and practical applications, aiming to make AI more accessible and useful across its ecosystem. The rollout of Gemini 3 represents a significant step forward in the development of AI agents, enabling more sophisticated and autonomous interactions.
