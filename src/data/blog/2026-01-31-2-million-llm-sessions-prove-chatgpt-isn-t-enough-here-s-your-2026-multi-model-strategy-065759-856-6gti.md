> ChatGPT owns 84% of discovery, but Copilot and Claude are exploding 10x faster—your single-model bet is doomed.

You're building that killer SaaS app relying on ChatGPT APIs, right? What if data from *2 million* real sessions screams it's a strategic disaster?[1]

The bombshell analysis (Jan 2025-Dec 2025 data) shatters myths: ChatGPT grabs 84.1% of trackable traffic as the 'default discovery' tool, but Copilot and Claude grew **8-10x faster**. Perplexity niches in finance (rivaling Bloomberg), Gemini sticks to knowledge workflows. Nadella boasts Copilot's 100M MAU; Anthropic's revenue rocketed to $8-10B.[1]

Developers, this rewires your stack: No more 'one LLM to rule them all.' Route finance queries to Perplexity, coding to Claude/Copilot, general to GPT. Multi-platform beats single-vendor lock-in, matching user productivity flows across industries like finance/SaaS.[1]

Unlike uniform benchmarks, real usage shows LLMs specialize—ChatGPT for broad ideation, specialists for depth. AI penetration? Likely 2-3x higher than reported, as 30-40% Gemini traffic hides.[1]

**Actionable:** Audit your app's queries, A/B test Copilot/Claude integrations via APIs. Track growth like this study—tools like LangChain make routing trivial. Will you diversify before competitors eat your lunch?
