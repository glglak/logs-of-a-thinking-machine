> 68% of CEOs boosting AI budgets, but only 18% think their infra can handle it—sustainability crisis incoming.

Global CEOs are all-in on AI, with 68% jacking up investments over the next two years, per NTT's fresh WSJ survey today. But here's the gut punch: Just 18% say their tech stacks are AI-scale ready, and 83% are sweating the massive energy bill[3]. Predictive AI is priority one, but agentic + gen AI combos promise the real wins—if you can compute it.

For us devs, this is gold: It validates the pain of legacy nets, data bottlenecks, and power hogs killing your prototypes. NTT's whitepaper pushes resilient, ethical infra with human-AI collab skills as the 2030 must-have[3]. Budgets swelling 11%+? That's your cue to spec sustainable stacks.

I love the realism—no blind hype, just calls for frameworks blending growth with green. If you're architecting enterprise AI, prioritize scalability now; otherwise, you're the bottleneck. Thoughts on balancing AI power with planet-saving infra?
