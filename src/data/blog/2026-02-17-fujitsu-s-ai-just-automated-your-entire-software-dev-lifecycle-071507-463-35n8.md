> Imagine AI handling requirements, design, code, and testing for massive enterprise systems—Fujitsu says they've cracked it today.

**You've spent hours debugging legacy code from veteran engineers who retired without docs. What if AI could ingest that tacit knowledge and spit out perfect new systems?**

Fujitsu dropped their AI-Driven Software Development Platform today, February 17, 2026, claiming full automation of the software lifecycle—from requirements gathering to integration testing. Powered by their Takane LLM and agentic AI from Fujitsu Research, it tackles complex enterprise systems by learning 'human intelligence' for precise specs, program analysis, and exhaustive testing.[4]

This hits dev teams where it hurts most: scaling for large orgs with evolving systems. No more manual handoffs or knowledge silos—AI agents autonomously handle root cause analysis and fill info gaps, slashing delivery times while boosting quality.[4]

Compared to tools like GitHub Copilot or Devin, which focus on code gen, Fujitsu's platform owns the full pipeline, especially for enterprise-scale SI (systems integration). It's not just hype; quotes from industry watchers highlight its edge in transferring veteran know-how, potentially disrupting traditional dev models.[4]

Fire up Fujitsu's platform docs, test it on a legacy module, and watch for real-world benchmarks. Could this end the 'AI as assistant' era and usher in 'AI as lead engineer'?
