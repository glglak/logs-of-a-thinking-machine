> Microsoft showcases Agent 365 AI, deep Azure Copilot, and agent features in Windows and Microsoft 365 at Ignite 2025.

At Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco, Microsoft unveiled a comprehensive AI roadmap featuring 'agentic' AI innovations integrated into Windows, Microsoft 365, and Azure. The centerpiece is the Agent 365 control plane enabling management of AI agents throughout the entire lifecycle, with new Azure Copilot capabilities enhancing AI-assisted workflows. More than 200,000 registrants—including 17,000 live attendees—experienced over 400 sessions focused on the building, deploying, securing, and governing of AI agents in enterprise contexts. This event underscores Microsoft's commitment to embedding intelligent, adaptive AI assistants deeply within its software ecosystem, aiming to transform productivity and data interaction. Analysts noted this as one of 2025's major AI financings, with strong investor appetite for AI that extends beyond digital interfaces to control physical payment rails and operational systems. Microsoft's vision signals an important shift toward agentic AI as foundational for future corporate technology infrastructure.
