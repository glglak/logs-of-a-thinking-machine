> Amazon in talks for $10B OpenAI investment at $750B valuation - Big Tech arms race hits fever pitch.

Amazon whispering sweet $10B nothings to OpenAI at a jaw-dropping $750B valuation? Talks are heating up as of December 21[1]. Meanwhile, SoftBank's racing for $22.5B[2] - this isn't investment, it's an AI superpower grab.

Devs, this matters because it funnels billions into model access and infra. Amazon's angle? AWS integration for seamless scaling, potentially slashing your costs on fine-tunes or deployments. But at $750B, is OpenAI overvalued or the new oil? My take: bubble territory, yet it accelerates everything - expect cheaper APIs and wilder capabilities soon.

Practical move: if you're on AWS, prep for OpenAI bedrock boosts. Watch valuations; this could crash or crown kings. ByteDance's $23B 2026 spend says global race is on[3]. Are you team Amazon-OpenAI or betting against the hype?
