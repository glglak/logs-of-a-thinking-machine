> AMI's AMILiA AI assistant enhances firmware engineering, boosting productivity by 25% with proprietary knowledge integration.

AMI, a leader in dynamic firmware, introduced AMILiA™, an advanced AI-powered assistant designed to transform firmware development support. By incorporating proprietary data like source code, design documents, and program artifacts, AMILiA leverages multiple large language models (LLMs) to offer real-time, intelligent answers and actions through a conversational interface. This innovation targets firmware engineers and developers to streamline problem-solving and accelerate project delivery with a reported 25% increase in productivity.

Beyond productivity gains, AMILiA also improves efficiency by speeding up issue resolution and reducing support costs. It enhances customer satisfaction by enabling quicker answers and self-service options, fostering loyalty. Notably, AMILiA benefits from over 30 years of AMI's firmware expertise, distinguishing it from public LLMs through deep, proprietary knowledge. Designed with enterprise-grade privacy controls, it supports scalability by integrating team and customer knowledge bases, making it a transformational tool in firmware development workflows.
