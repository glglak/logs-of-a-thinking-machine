> University of Hong Kong just unveiled generative AI that builds 3D scenes in real-time on your phone – fueled by a massive $3B gov push.

Governments throwing cash at AI? Usually crickets. But Hong Kong's $3 billion supercomputing subsidy scheme is delivering *today*.[2] HKU engineers built a generative AI for real-time 3D scene generation that runs on phones and desktops – think instant virtual worlds for AR/VR or game dev.[2]

Why care as a dev? This isn't lab toy; it's subsidized at 70% for 20+ projects, democratizing high-end compute.[2] Your next app could gen photoreal 3D environments on-device, no cloud required. Practical win: slash costs for spatial computing prototypes, from metaverse hacks to training sims.

Honest opinion: while US/EU bicker over regs, Asia's just building. This could flood open-source with edge-optimized 3D gens. Game-changer for indie devs? Absolutely. What's your first project with on-device 3D AI?
