> Huang calls it the 'ChatGPT moment for robotics' - and now devs get open tools to build it.

**Imagine training robots that learn in simulated worlds faster than real life ever could.** Nvidia's Jensen Huang just predicted a billion robots by 2027, and yesterday they made it real with a massive open-source drop for Physical AI.

Nvidia released a suite of **open models, frameworks, and AI infrastructure** specifically for physical AI - think customizable world models for synthetic data generation, robot policy evaluation in simulation, an open reasoning vision language model, and a vision language action model. This isn't hype; it's production-ready tools that slash training times using high-fidelity physics sims and photorealistic rendering[4]. Paired with exploding GPU compute, it's solving the biggest bottlenecks in robot dev.

For developers, this is huge: **no more siloed robot training**. Reuse intelligence across tasks with multimodal foundation models that grok objects, space, and generalization. Build robots for warehouses, healthcare, or homes without starting from scratch every time[4].

Compared to closed systems like Boston Dynamics or Tesla Optimus, Nvidia's stack is **open and scalable**. It democratizes Physical AI, letting indie devs and startups compete while Big Tech scales to billions of units. This shifts robotics from lab toy to deployable reality.

**Grab the models from Nvidia's repo today and spin up a sim.** Train your first policy this week - what's the first robot task you're automating? Watch for integrations with ROS2 and real-world benchmarks.
