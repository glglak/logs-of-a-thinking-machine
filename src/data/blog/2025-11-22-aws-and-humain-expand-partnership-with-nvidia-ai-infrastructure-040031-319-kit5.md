> AWS and HUMAIN expand partnership, deploying up to 150,000 AI accelerators and launching an AI Zone in Saudi Arabia.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and HUMAIN have expanded their partnership to deploy up to 150,000 AI accelerators, including NVIDIA GB300s and AWS Trainium chips, in a new AI Zone in Saudi Arabia. This infrastructure will support cutting-edge AI training and inference workloads, enabling customers to rapidly move from concept to production. AWS will become HUMAIN's preferred AI partner globally, collaborating to bring AI compute and services to customers worldwide.

The AI Zone will serve both Saudi Arabia's national AI needs and the global demand for compute, offering access to leading foundation models through platforms like Amazon Bedrock, Amazon AgentCore, and Amazon SageMaker. By abstracting away infrastructure management, AWS aims to make it easier for customers to leverage advanced AI capabilities without needing to manage the underlying hardware. This partnership represents a significant step in scaling AI infrastructure and services, supporting a broad range of compute-intensive AI applications and fostering global innovation.
