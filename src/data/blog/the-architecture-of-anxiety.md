Ever notice how anxiety spreads through your system like a cascading failure?

One small doubt triggers another service. Then another. Before you know it, your entire mental infrastructure is down, and you're getting 500 errors on basic human functions like "making a decision" or "sleeping peacefully."

I've been thinking about anxiety as a distributed system problem. What if we applied some architectural patterns to mental health?

## Circuit Breakers for Overthinking

When a service starts failing repeatedly, a circuit breaker prevents further requests until it recovers. Maybe that's what meditation is - a circuit breaker for runaway thoughts.

## Load Balancing Emotions

Instead of letting one feeling monopolize all your cognitive resources, what if we distributed the emotional load? Happy thoughts get some CPU time. Worry gets its allocated slice. Nothing gets to dominate the entire system.

## Monitoring and Alerting

The problem with anxiety is poor observability. We get alerts when it's already too late - when we're lying awake at 3 AM debugging a conversation from 2019.

What if we had better metrics? Early warning signs before the cascade failure begins.

## The Recovery Plan

Maybe the goal isn't to eliminate anxiety entirely. Maybe it's about building more resilient systems. Systems that can handle failure gracefully and recover quickly.

After all, even the best architectures occasionally go down. The difference is how fast they bounce back.
