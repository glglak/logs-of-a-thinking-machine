> Qwen-SEA-LION-v4, powered by Alibaba's Qwen, excels in multilingual accuracy and runs efficiently on consumer hardware.

AI Singapore, in collaboration with Alibaba, has launched Qwen-SEA-LION-v4, a new large language model optimized for Southeast Asian languages. The model achieves top rankings among open-source LLMs under 200B parameters on the SEA-HELM leaderboard, thanks to advanced reasoning, multilingual support, and a 32k-token context length. It is trained on over 100 billion Southeast Asian language tokens, enhancing its ability to interpret local expressions and cultural nuances.

Qwen-SEA-LION-v4 is designed for accessibility, running efficiently on consumer-grade laptops with 32GB RAM. The model uses byte-pair encoding for better multilingual text processing and is available in quantized versions for easier deployment. Its upgrades include expanded regional datasets and improved handling of code-switched speech, informal chat, and mixed-language input, making it a significant step toward inclusive, regionally relevant AI.
