> Google DeepMind's SIMA 2 AI agent uses goal-driven reasoning to navigate and learn in complex 3D virtual environments.

Google DeepMind introduced SIMA 2, an AI agent integrated with Gemini architecture that advances goal-driven reasoning within 3D virtual worlds. SIMA 2 goes beyond standard instruction-following by autonomously generating and pursuing multiple tasks in procedurally generated, unfamiliar environments such as MineDojo and ASKA. A key feature is its self-improvement loop, where the agent learns from failure and adapts its strategies, enhancing generalization across contexts.

This development is noteworthy because most AI systems struggle when faced with scenarios deviating from their training data, limiting real-world application. SIMA 2's ability to transfer skills and reason dynamically represents progress toward agents capable of operating effectively in complex, unpredictable settings. Google DeepMind's approach exemplifies ongoing bets that combining foundation models with reinforcement learning can unlock artificial general intelligence, though real-world impacts remain to be seen.
