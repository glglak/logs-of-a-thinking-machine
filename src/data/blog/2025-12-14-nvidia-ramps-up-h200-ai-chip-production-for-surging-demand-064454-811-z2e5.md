> Nvidia evaluates extra manufacturing for H200 chips to meet Chinese client demand, strengthening AI infrastructure amid global rivalry.

Nvidia is expanding production capacity for its H200 AI chips, driven by high demand particularly from Chinese clients. This move bolsters the AI hardware ecosystem as compute needs explode with advanced LLMs and models[1].

The H200, optimized for inference and training, addresses bottlenecks in data centers worldwide. Amid U.S.-China tech tensions, Nvidia's strategy ensures supply chain resilience and market dominance in AI accelerators[1].

This development highlights hardware's critical role in scaling AI, complementing software advances like GPT-5.2 by providing the necessary compute power for real-world deployment[1].
