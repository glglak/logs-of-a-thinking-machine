_Prompt injection risks in LLM apps_

Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to the AI revolution, but they also pose significant security risks. One such risk is prompt injection, where malicious inputs can manipulate LLM outputs. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches. Securing LLMs is crucial as they become increasingly integrated into various applications. Developing robust security measures against prompt injection is vital for maintaining the trustworthiness of AI systems.
