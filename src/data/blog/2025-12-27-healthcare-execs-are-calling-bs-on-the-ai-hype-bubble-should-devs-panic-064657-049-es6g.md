> Top healthcare leaders debate if AI is the next dot-com bust - time to rethink your medtech side hustle?

AI bubble alert! Healthcare leaders are straight-up debating if the frenzy is sustainable or headed for a pop, part 1 of what could be a reality check.[3] As a dev dipping into health AI, this convo is gold - no fluff, just real talk on ROI.

What happened? Execs from the frontlines are weighing explosive growth against risks like overpromising on LLMs in diagnostics or admin tools. For developers, it means questioning if your AI health app has true defensibility or if it's hype fuel.[3]

My hot take: Bubble or not, AI's sticking in healthcare for efficiency gains, but VCs might pull back. Build for regulation and data privacy now. Devs in medtech, you buying the bubble narrative or doubling down?
