> Turns out, you don't need to be human to master metalinguistic analysis—LLMs do it better, and now generate entire artificial languages on demand.

**We always said analyzing language itself was a 'human-only' superpower. LLMs just called our bluff.** Berkeley's Gašper Beguš dropped this bomb at OpenAI's forum: modern models don't mimic speech—they dissect syntax like linguists[1].

In breakthrough case studies, Beguš showed LLMs with **metalinguistic capabilities**, generating complex sentences and testing language limits. Paired with Project CETI's whale comms decoding (sperm whale 'phonemes' mirror human speech), it flips animal-human comms research. But the killer app? **ConlangCrafter**: an LLM system auto-generating coherent, diverse artificial languages for games, novels, or evo studies[1].

Devs, this is gold for procedural gen: craft lore languages for RPGs, simulate dialect evolution for chat agents, or probe LLM internals for novel insights. Beyond creativity, it tests 'what's uniquely human' in your prompting workflows[1].

Vs. prior tools like fragmented conlang generators, ConlangCrafter is **typologically diverse and coherent** out-of-box, leveraging LLM scale. Stacks with CETI's bio-AI bridges, pushing interpretability frontiers OpenAI's chasing[1].

**Fire up ConlangCrafter** (details via Beguš's lab), prompt a Elvish dialect for your game, and watch it evolve grammars. Does this mean AIs 'speak' more humanly than us—or redefine intelligence entirely?
