> Hon Hai partners with OpenAI to manufacture advanced AI systems and expand US supply chain with $1-5B investment.

Hon Hai Precision Industry (Foxconn) announced a strategic collaboration with OpenAI to develop next-generation AI infrastructure and strengthen US local supply chains for advanced AI system deployment. OpenAI will provide hardware insights to support Hon Hai’s design and development efforts in its US manufacturing sites. Hon Hai is set to invest between $1 billion and $5 billion to expand its US footprint, aiming to double server rack assembly capacity to approximately 2,000 per week.

Additionally, Hon Hai will form a joint venture with Intrinsic (an Alphabet subsidiary) to innovate AI-driven factory automation focusing on electronic product assembly, utilizing Intrinsic's Vision Model and robotic toolkits. This collaboration targets a transformative approach in manufacturing through versatile intelligent robots and full factory orchestration. Hon Hai also introduced a new Model A electric vehicle designed chiefly by its Japanese team, marking a push beyond traditional electronics into AI and automotive tech.
