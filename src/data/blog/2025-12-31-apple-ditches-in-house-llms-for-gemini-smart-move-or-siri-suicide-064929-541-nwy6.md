> Apple's hoarding $13B cash while rivals burn billions – now they're sneaking Gemini into Siri. Genius or giveaway?

Picture this: Everyone's racing to build monster LLMs, torching cash on data centers, and Apple's like, 'Nah, we'll hybrid it with Google's Gemini.' After Siri delays and WWDC hype fizzling, they're pivoting to integrate Gemini for 2026 features while keeping internal models on a leash. With $13B in reserves and no big buys this year, they've got flexibility rivals envy.[2]

For devs, this screams pragmatism – LLMs are commoditizing fast, so why not optimize integration over parameter wars? Focus shifts to slick UI like 'Liquid Glass' and efficient AI delivery. It's a wake-up: Chasing SOTA models might be a trap when APIs get good enough.[2]

My hot take? Bold restraint in an AI frenzy. Could supercharge Apple Intelligence without bankruptcy. But will it wow by 2026? Devs, are you team 'build your own' or 'glue the best together'? Let's debate.
