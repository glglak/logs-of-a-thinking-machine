> Q.ANT's next-gen photonic processor boosts AI and HPC with faster, energy-efficient nonlinear processing.

Q.ANT announced its second-generation Native Processing Unit (NPU 2), spotlighted at Supercomputing 2025. This photonic processor significantly advances nonlinear processing capabilities, offering dramatic improvements in energy efficiency and performance for AI and HPC applications. The company demonstrated live AI image learning that processes visual data within seconds, a marked leap from previous rudimentary digit recognition in under a year.

Photonic computing scales faster than traditional CMOS technology, enabling applications such as computer vision in manufacturing and logistics with reduced energy demands and complexity. These processors excel at nonlinear neural networks, empowering smarter AI models that integrate statistical reasoning and physical modeling. This technology promises to accelerate developments in drug discovery, materials science, and adaptive optimization by efficiently handling nonlinear complexity with minimal energy consumption.
