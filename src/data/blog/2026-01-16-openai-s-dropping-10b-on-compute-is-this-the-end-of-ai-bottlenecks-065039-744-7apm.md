> OpenAI just locked in 750 megawatts of compute through 2028 – here's why this massive deal changes everything for devs building on their stack.

Hold up – OpenAI signing a **$10 billion deal** with Cerebras for insane compute power? This isn't just big money; it's a direct shot at killing inference latency for their models. As a dev who's tired of waiting minutes for API responses on complex prompts, this has me pumped. They're securing 750 megawatts through 2028, purely to turbocharge products like GPT series.[1]

Why does this hit different for us? Compute shortages have been the silent killer for prototyping agents or scaling side projects. With Cerebras' wafer-scale chips, we're talking inference speeds that could make real-time apps feasible without breaking the bank. I've seen costs skyrocket on cloud GPUs; this partnership screams optimization at scale, potentially trickling down cheaper, faster access for everyone.

But here's my hot take: If OpenAI pulls this off, it widens their moat even more. Smaller players might get squeezed out. Still, as devs, we win if it means buttery-smooth o1-style reasoning in production sooner. Are you rethinking your stack around this?
