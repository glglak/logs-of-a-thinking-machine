_Unsloth introduces new RL capabilities_

Unsloth has made significant strides in reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing new capabilities that make RL more accessible and efficient. Their mission includes supporting OpenAI's gpt-oss models and vision models, along with more memory-efficient RL solutions. Unsloth's advancements have been benchmarked against state-of-the-art models, such as Claude-4-Opus and GPT-4.1, showcasing impressive performance. For instance, Unsloth's 3-bit GGUF achieved a 75.6% score on the Aider benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness even at lower precision. This progress in RL is crucial for developing more sophisticated AI agents that can learn and adapt in complex environments. By leveraging these technologies, Unsloth aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of AI systems.
