> Stack Overflow reveals dev paradox: most code with AI daily, but trust? A measly 30% - what's breaking our faith in LLMs?

Stack Overflow just spilled the tea in their latest survey: 80% of developers are knee-deep in AI tools daily, cranking out code faster than ever. But trust those outputs? Only 30% feel confident. Mistral AI gets a nod too, but this dev confidence gap is the real story shaking up how we build.[4]

As someone who's copy-pasted a dozen Copilot suggestions this week, this resonates hard. AI's speed boost is undeniable for boilerplate and debugging, but that trust chasm? It's why we're still double-checking every line - hallucinations and subtle bugs kill deploys. For practical devs, it means hybrid workflows: AI for acceleration, human review for truth.

My opinion: this paradox is AI's growing pains, not a death knell. Tools like Claude or GPT-5 are closing the gap, but we need better verification layers (unit tests on steroids?). Stack Overflow calling it out forces the industry to level up. Fellow devs, what's your AI trust score - over or under 30%?
