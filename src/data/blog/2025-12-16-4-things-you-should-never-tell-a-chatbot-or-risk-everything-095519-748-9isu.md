> I just learned the fatal mistakes devs make with AI chatbots - and how one slip-up could leak your entire codebase.

Ever pasted proprietary code into ChatGPT thinking 'it's fine'? Yeah, me too - until today's wake-up call. This AI Today podcast drops the bomb on **4 things you should never tell a chatbot**, straight from Business Insider wisdom. We're talking PII, sensitive biz secrets, health data, and anything that could train the next model on your dime. As devs, we're the front lines, but one copy-paste blunder and your IP is toast.

Why does this hit home? Because I've seen teams build apps on LLM outputs without a second thought, only to realize the model 'remembers' too much. Practical fix: always use local models like Ollama for sensitive stuff, anonymize data before prompting, and treat every chat like it's public Twitter. Compliance isn't boring - it's your job security in an AI world.

Honest take: Big Tech won't warn you; they're banking on your laziness. Start auditing your prompts today - what's the dumbest thing you've fed an AI? Drop it in comments.
