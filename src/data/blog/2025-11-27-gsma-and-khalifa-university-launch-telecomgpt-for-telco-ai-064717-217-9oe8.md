> GSMA and Khalifa University unveil TelecomGPT, a telco-first LLM to accelerate AI adoption in telecom.

GSMA Foundry and Khalifa University have announced the development of TelecomGPT, a specialized large language model (LLM) tailored for the telecommunications industry. This telco-first AI model is designed to address the unique challenges of interpreting telecom standards, troubleshooting networks, and handling technical documentation. The collaboration will also release an Open Telco Knowledge Graph built on 3GPP documentation, hosted on Hugging Face, and benchmarking frameworks to assess model performance in real-world telecom scenarios.

The initiative is part of the GSMA Open-Telco LLM Benchmarks, which has grown into a collaborative platform for mobile operators to experiment with and validate LLMs for telecom applications. The community features a leaderboard and plans to expand its evaluation criteria to include energy efficiency, latency, and agent performance. This marks a significant step toward making AI solutions more accurate, safe, and efficient for the mobile ecosystem.
