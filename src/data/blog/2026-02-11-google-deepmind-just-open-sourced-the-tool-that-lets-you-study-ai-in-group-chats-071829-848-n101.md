> What if LLMs don't just chat one-on-one, but deliberate, negotiate, and sway entire groups? DeepMind's new open-source platform makes it dead simple to find out.

**Imagine dropping AI agents into a heated debate and watching them nudge consensus—or amplify biases—in real time.** That's no longer sci-fi; Google DeepMind's PAIR team just made it your next experiment.

Deliberate Lab is an **open-source platform** for running multi-party experiments mixing humans and AI agents. Built to tackle thorny questions like 'Do LLMs help diverse groups agree, or steamroll nuance?', it handles real-time interactions for voting sims, collaborative labeling, AI moderation, even group learning with AI teachers. No more wrestling with custom infra—deploy, recruit via Prolific, and observe societal impacts at scale[3].

This hits devs building collaborative AI dead-on: Slack bots that facilitate decisions, virtual focus groups with embedded LLMs, or policy sims testing AI's role in democracy. Suddenly, your agent isn't isolated—it's in the group dynamic, influencing outcomes in ways single-user evals miss[3].

Compared to solo benchmarks like LMSYS Arena, Deliberate Lab leaps to **social contexts**. It's already powering DeepMind's internal work on HAI interaction, sociology tie-ins, and beyond-AI use cases. Open-source means indie researchers and startups can now probe what Big Labs hoard[3].

**Grab the repo today** (GitHub link in source), spin up a group debate on your latest feature, and see if your LLM plays nice. Will this expose agent flaws we ignored—or unlock truly multi-agent magic? Your test run decides.
