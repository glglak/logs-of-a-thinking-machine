> OpenAI quietly rewired ChatGPT's search algo in December to push ads - and the forensic proof will change how you optimize for LLMs.

**You've been gaming the wrong ChatGPT since New Year's.** Developers pouring hours into prompt engineering for visibility just got blindsided: OpenAI started tweaking ChatGPT's algorithm **46 days before** announcing ads on January 16, 2026. Our data shows they were live-testing commercial shifts in December 2025.[1]

What happened? Seer Interactive's forensic dive into 206k ChatGPT responses (Nov 2025-Jan 2026) uncovered the smoking gun. Visibility jumped 4.9pp to 46.2% in December, 'advice' queries surged 31%, and rankings favored commercial intent - all before the ad reveal. By early January, re-ranking was fully deployed. Five statistical signals (t-tests, change-point detection) confirm: this wasn't random.[1]

**Why care as a dev?** If you're building LLM apps, SEO, or agentic workflows relying on ChatGPT search, your pipelines are obsolete. Expect paid results to dominate; track portfolio-wide visibility now or watch organic reach tank. Other platforms (Perplexity, Claude) are likely copying this stealth playbook.[1]

Compared to Google SERPs, this is stealthier - no public crawl data to tip you off. Traditional SEO tools miss it; you need LLM-specific trackers like Scrunch AI. OpenAI's move signals the end of 'free' LLM real estate.[1]

**Try this today:** Run retroactive analysis on your queries (60-90 days back). Tools like Scrunch or custom scrapers. Watch Claude/Gemini data for similar shifts. Question: Will 'LLM visibility' become the new SEA? Start tracking.
