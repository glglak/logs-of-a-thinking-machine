> Couchbase AI Services integrate Nvidia AI Enterprise to speed LLM apps by unifying data access across cloud and on-prem databases.

Couchbase unveiled new AI Services designed to streamline the development of generative AI and agentic applications by tightly integrating operational data with large language models (LLMs). These services reduce complexity and data access latency whether deployed on premises or in the cloud, enabling faster and more contextual LLM engagements. A pivotal part of the stack is integration with Nvidia AI Enterprise technologies such as NIM microservices and Nemotron models, which support sophisticated AI functionalities like automatic vector creation, storage, and intelligent agent memory across sessions. The platform also offers AI governance and validation, ensuring agent actions comply with data policies and business rules. By becoming 'the memory and context layer' for AI applications, Couchbase’s AI services enable developers and ISVs to build secure, compliant commercial apps more rapidly. This aligns with industry trends emphasizing the close fusion of AI models and real-time enterprise data to enhance AI-driven business outcomes.
