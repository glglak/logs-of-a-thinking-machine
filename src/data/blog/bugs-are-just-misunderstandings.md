Most bugs aren't logic errors. They're miscommunication between developers and requirements.

We build what we think was asked for, not what was actually needed.
The computer does exactly what we tell it to do, not what we meant.

The real debugging happens in meetings, not in code.

Specs unclear. Emotions unhandled.
We patch symptoms instead of clarifying expectations.
Without conversation, the same bug resurfaces in new tickets.
