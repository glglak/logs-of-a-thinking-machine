![Intel's New AI Chips Just Made Edge AI Actually Feasible (And They're Made in the USA)](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ces2026-laptop-display3-v2-scaled.jpg)

> Intel dropped Core Ultra Series 3 at CES – first 18A chips built in the US, crushing LLMs and edge AI with insane efficiency.

Forget the hype around cloud-only AI – Intel just flipped the script with Core Ultra Series 3 processors, the first AI PC platform on their homegrown 18A tech made in the USA. We're talking up to 1.9x better LLM performance, 2.3x video analytics per watt, and 4.5x throughput on vision-language-action models. As a dev, this means I can finally ditch power-hungry GPU rigs for edge deployments in robotics, smart cities, and healthcare without breaking the bank on TCO.[2]

What gets me excited? These aren't just PCs – Series 3 edge processors are certified for industrial hell: extended temps, 24/7 reliability, and deterministic performance. Powering 200+ designs from global partners, they're available *this month*. Imagine shipping AI apps to automation or healthcare without the multi-chip nightmare – single SoC handling it all with x86 compatibility you can actually trust.[2]

Honest take: Intel's playing catch-up to ARM in efficiency, but US manufacturing and broad adoption could kill import dependency. Devs, if you're building edge AI, prototype on these ASAP – your battery life and wallet will thank you. Who's testing Series 3 first?[2]
