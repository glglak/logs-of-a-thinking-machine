> OpenAI rolls out GPT-5.1; Baidu launches ERNIE 5.0, a multimodal model outperforming GPT-4o on video tasks.

OpenAI has released GPT-5.1 in two variants, marking a significant leap in reasoning and multimodal capabilities. The new model is designed to handle complex, long-horizon tasks with improved reliability and planning. Simultaneously, Baidu unveiled ERNIE 5.0, a fully omni-modal AI excelling in text, image, and video understanding. ERNIE 5.0 is powered by Baidu's in-house Kunlun chips and a supercomputing suite, enabling it to outperform GPT-4o on multilingual video tasks. The 28-billion-parameter ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking variant leads in document reasoning, strengthening China's position in industrial and enterprise AI. These releases signal a shift from chatbots to autonomous reasoning agents, paving the way for advanced applications in robotics and software engineering. However, interpretability remains a challenge, with 42% of AI code still failing without warning.
