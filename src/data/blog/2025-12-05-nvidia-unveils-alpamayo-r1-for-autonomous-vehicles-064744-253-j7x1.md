> NVIDIA launches Alpamayo-R1, an open-source vision language model for autonomous driving, at NeurIPS 2025.

NVIDIA has introduced Alpamayo-R1, the first open-source vision language action model designed specifically for autonomous vehicles. Announced at NeurIPS 2025, Alpamayo-R1 integrates visual and textual reasoning to enhance decision-making in real-world driving environments. This model represents a significant step forward in the development of AI for robotics and autonomous systems, enabling vehicles to interpret complex scenes and respond to dynamic situations with greater accuracy and reliability.

Alpamayo-R1's open-source nature encourages collaboration and innovation within the research and development communities, potentially accelerating the deployment of safer and more intelligent autonomous vehicles. The model's ability to combine vision and language processing allows for more nuanced understanding of traffic scenarios, pedestrian behavior, and environmental cues. This development underscores NVIDIA's commitment to advancing AI in critical applications like transportation, where safety and reliability are paramount.
