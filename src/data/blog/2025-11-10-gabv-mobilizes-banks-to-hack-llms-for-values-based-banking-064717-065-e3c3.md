> 72 values-based banks collaborate to reshape how LLMs describe ethical banking.

The Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) has launched a coordinated effort to 'hack' large language models by flooding them with definitions of values-based banking. The goal is to counteract the bias in AI tools that currently favor profit-driven finance narratives.



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
