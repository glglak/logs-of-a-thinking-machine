> Google's Gemini 3 Deep Research Agent hits 46.4% on Humanity's Last Exam, autonomously handling multi-step tasks—empowering devs with Interactions API for AI research in apps. Game-changer unveiled. (148 characters)

Picture an AI that doesn't just answer questions but plans, executes, and synthesizes deep research autonomously—Google's Gemini 3 Deep Research Agent, launched just days ago, does exactly that, scoring 46.4% on the grueling Humanity's Last Exam benchmark. This marks a pivotal shift from reactive chatbots to proactive research engines[1].

Technically, powered by Gemini 3 Pro, it breaks down complex queries into multi-step plans, leveraging a new Interactions API for seamless developer integration into custom apps. It handles due diligence, market analysis, and competitive intel with human-like execution, far beyond single-turn interactions[1].

Developers can now offload research-heavy workflows, embedding agentic AI into tools for SMBs lacking research teams—ideal for real-time insights in sales, strategy, or dev ops. Tech leaders gain scalable intelligence without hiring armies of analysts[1].

This agent hints at AI's evolution into 'digital colleagues,' blurring lines between tools and thinkers. Yet, as autonomy grows, so do questions: who governs these research black boxes, and how do we ensure their 'discoveries' align with truth over hallucination?[1]
