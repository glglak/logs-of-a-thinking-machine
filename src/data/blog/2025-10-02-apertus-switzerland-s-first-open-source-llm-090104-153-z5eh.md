_Apertus is Switzerland's first open-source large language model._

Apertus represents a significant milestone as Switzerland's first large-scale, fully open-source large language model. Developed collaboratively by researchers from EPFL, ETH Zurich, and other institutions, Apertus aims to democratize AI access and promote transparency in LLM development. This open-source approach allows for community involvement and contributions, potentially leading to more diverse and robust AI systems. The development of Apertus highlights the growing interest in accessible and collaborative AI research.
