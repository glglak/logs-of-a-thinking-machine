> C-suite execs predict AI spend triples by 2030, yet most worry it'll flop without real business glue – wake-up call for devs.

Fresh IBM study from today screams one thing: AI isn't optional anymore – it's make-or-break for business by 2030. 2,000 execs say investments will surge 150%, with 67% betting it'll smash resource limits and spark new jobs. But here's the gut punch: 68% think their AI push will crash because it's not woven into core ops.[3]

Devs, this is your cue. AI-first companies are 48% more likely to invent roles and restructure for max value. Forget hype – success means bolder bets on integrated AI, not siloed pilots. IBM's Mohamad Ali nails it: Winners will own AI assets, outpace rivals, and ship innovations fast.

My hot take? If you're coding AI today, prioritize business alignment over shiny models. Build agents that automate decisions, not just chat. Roadmap's out – grab it and stress-test your stack. Will your team be the 32% that nails it, or join the failure club? Let's chat strategies in comments.[3]
