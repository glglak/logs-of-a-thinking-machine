> Olmo 3 offers full lifecycle transparency and community-driven open development for advanced reasoning LLMs.

The Allen Institute for AI has launched Olmo 3, a new open-source language model family that emphasizes full transparency throughout the model lifecycle. Unlike typical LLM releases that share only final weights, Olmo 3 provides developers insight into training data, intermediate reasoning steps, and post-training options including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach enables users to trace outputs back to data sources and experiment with model customization. At its core is Olmo 3-Think (32B), a reasoning-focused model excelling in math and multi-turn tasks, alongside smaller 7B variants tailored for coding, instruction following, and reinforcement learning research. The models demonstrate performance competitive with top open-weight models and maintain quality over very long contexts. All artifacts are permissively licensed, fostering an open development ecosystem for education and applied AI projects. This release marks a significant step forward in open, transparent LLM research and community collaboration, addressing a key limitation of prior opaque models.[1]
