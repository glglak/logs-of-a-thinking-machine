> Lisa Su says AI is flipping hiring on its head—developers, this could mean more demand for your skills than ever.

Forget the doomsday headlines: AMD CEO Lisa Su just revealed AI is reshaping hiring practices without wiping out jobs, and as a dev, I'm breathing a sigh of relief.[1] In today's top stories, she emphasized how AI tools are augmenting workforces, pushing companies to hire for AI-savvy roles over rote tasks. This isn't just CEO spin—it's a signal that the AI boom is creating hybrid jobs where humans + models crush it.

For developers, this hits home hard. We're already seeing job postings demand proficiency in fine-tuning LLMs, prompt engineering, and integrating APIs like Grok or Llama. If Su's right, expect hiring managers to prioritize folks who can wield AI like a superpower, not replace them with it. I've been experimenting with AI code assistants in my workflows, and yeah, it speeds up boilerplate but amplifies creative problem-solving—exactly what she describes.

The practical takeaway? Level up now: dive into AMD's ROCm for open-source AI training or build side projects showcasing AI integration. But let's be real, this assumes companies adapt fast—will they? What's your take: AI job savior or silent killer?
