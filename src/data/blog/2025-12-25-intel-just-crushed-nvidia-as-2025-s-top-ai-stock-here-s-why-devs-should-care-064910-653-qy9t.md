![Intel Just Crushed Nvidia as 2025's Top AI Stock - Here's Why Devs Should Care](https://img.youtube.com/vi/reucFH0Xg4c/maxresdefault.jpg)

> Forget Nvidia hype - Intel surged 81% this year as the real AI winner, and it's got devs rethinking their chip stacks.

You know that feeling when the underdog sneaks up and steals the show? That's Intel in 2025, up 81.4% YTD while everyone's obsessed with Nvidia. I was glued to this Yahoo Finance chat, and it hit me: the AI trade isn't just about GPUs anymore - it's diversifying, and Intel's making a massive comeback.[2]

As a dev, this matters because Intel's resurgence means cheaper, more accessible AI hardware options. No longer chained to hyperscaler clouds or Nvidia's premium pricing, you can experiment with edge AI or local inference without breaking the bank. Meta and Amazon are dumping billions into infra, but Intel's stock pop signals supply chain shifts that could lower your costs too.[2]

My take? Investors are underestimating how this shakes up dev workflows. If Intel keeps climbing into 2026, expect more open-source tools optimized for their chips. Who's switching their next project to Intel hardware?
