> Unanet introduces Champ AI, a secure, governed natural-language copilot for government contracting and AEC firms.

Unanet has launched Champ AI, a multi-agent intelligence platform designed as a natural-language copilot for government contracting (GovCon) and architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms. Built on a secure, extensible AI architecture, Champ AI unifies data, reasoning, and automation across Unanet's portfolio, offering transparency, control, and trustworthy enterprise-ready generative AI.



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
