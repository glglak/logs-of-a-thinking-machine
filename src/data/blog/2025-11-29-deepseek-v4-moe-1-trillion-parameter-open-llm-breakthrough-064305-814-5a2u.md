> DeepSeek-V4, the largest open MoE LLM, achieves GPT-5-like performance with 1 trillion parameters and sparse activation.

DeepSeek-V4 has emerged as the largest open Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model to date, boasting a staggering 1 trillion parameters. Unlike traditional dense models that activate all weights for every token, MoE models like DeepSeek-V4 activate only a fraction—typically less than 10% per token—making them highly efficient and scalable. This architectural innovation allows DeepSeek-V4 to deliver GPT-5-level capabilities without the massive computational overhead, signaling a paradigm shift in how AI models are designed and scaled.

The model’s architecture, featuring 16-expert routing and auxiliary-free balancing, sets a new benchmark for sparse model design. DeepSeek’s philosophy emphasizes packing knowledge into model parameters, potentially integrating multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. This approach is complementary to other strategies, such as reinforcement learning and memory modules, which are being explored in parallel. The release of DeepSeek-V4 not only accelerates the race toward AGI but also democratizes access to cutting-edge AI through open-source principles. Its influence is expected to shape future architectures, making large-scale AI more cost-effective and accessible.
