> Anthropic dropped Claude Cowork, an AI agent that *actually works* on real tasks – no more hype, just results.

Okay, AI agents have been the ultimate promise-kept-late. But Anthropic's **Claude Cowork**? This thing is a game-changer – a practical AI coworker handling workflows without the usual hallucinations or dead ends.[2]

From what leaked in today's updates, it's designed for dev-like tasks: debugging, code reviews, even coordinating multi-step projects. As someone who's burned hours on flaky agents, this feels like the first one ready for prime time. No more babysitting prompts; it *works* in production settings, per the buzz.

Practical angle: Imagine plugging this into your CI/CD or VS Code for autonomous fixes. It could slash debugging time by 50% on my team. Honest opinion? Anthropic's safety-first vibe might make it more reliable than OpenAI's wildcards. But will it scale without enterprise pricing killing it? Devs, drop your agent war stories – is this the one?
