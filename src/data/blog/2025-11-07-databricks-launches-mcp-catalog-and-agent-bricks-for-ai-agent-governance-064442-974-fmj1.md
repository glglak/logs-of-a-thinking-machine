> Databricks introduces MCP Catalog and Agent Bricks to help enterprises discover, govern, and scale AI agents securely.

Databricks has launched new capabilities to help enterprises build, govern, and scale trusted AI agents. The MCP Catalog (Beta) enables discovery and governance of Model Context Protocol integrations, while Agent Bricks provides a unified platform for connecting LLMs to external tools and orchestrating multi-agent workflows. These tools address key challenges in deploying AI agents at scale, including security, governance, and real-time action across enterprise data.



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
