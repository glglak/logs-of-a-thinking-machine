> Foxconn and OpenAI partner to boost U.S. AI hardware and smart manufacturing.

Foxconn and OpenAI have announced a strategic alliance aimed at reshaping U.S. AI manufacturing. The partnership will focus on integrating AI hardware, model deployment, and smart manufacturing processes, leveraging Foxconn’s global supply chain expertise and OpenAI’s advanced AI technology. This move aligns with U.S. efforts to reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing, especially in semiconductors and AI infrastructure.

The alliance supports the expansion of the CHIPS Act to include AI data centers, servers, and power grid components, which could lower capital costs and attract private investment. By producing AI hardware domestically, the partnership aims to mitigate geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions. The collaboration is expected to enhance supply chain resilience, cut costs, and position the U.S. as a leader in global AI manufacturing and technology self-sufficiency.
