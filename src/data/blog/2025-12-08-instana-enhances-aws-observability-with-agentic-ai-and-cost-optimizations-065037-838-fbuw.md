> Instana advances AWS observability for agentic AI workloads and cuts cloud costs with private telemetry over AWS PrivateLink.

Instana’s latest updates for AWS observability add deep support for agentic AI systems built using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, which coordinate autonomous multi-step reasoning and tool usage. By ingesting OpenTelemetry signals from agents, Instana visualizes model behavior and call chains within AWS infrastructure, enabling sophisticated monitoring of complex AI workflows. Additionally, Instana introduces conversational querying via natural language from Amazon Kiro IDE and CLI, streamlining AI-assisted troubleshooting for developers. The platform also supports AWS PrivateLink end-to-end private observability, allowing telemetry data to flow securely without public IPs and reducing network egress costs by up to 90% in early deployments. These improvements are critical as AI systems grow more complex and enterprises seek tighter integration and cost-efficient cloud operations.
