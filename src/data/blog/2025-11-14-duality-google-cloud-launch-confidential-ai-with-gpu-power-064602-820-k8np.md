> Duality and Google Cloud introduce confidential AI with GPU-powered secure LLM training and inference.

Duality Technologies and Google Cloud have launched a new confidential AI solution, enabling enterprises to securely process sensitive AI workloads at scale using NVIDIA GPU-powered confidential virtual machines. This advancement allows for large language model (LLM) training and inference, as well as encrypted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), within trusted execution environments. Previously, confidential AI was limited to CPU-only instances, which constrained performance and scalability. Now, with GPU acceleration, organizations can achieve production-scale, privacy-preserving AI without sacrificing performance. The solution addresses regulatory and privacy concerns, as highlighted by a UBS survey showing compliance as a major barrier to AI adoption. Nelly Porter, Director of Product Management at Google Cloud, noted that pairing NVIDIA H100-powered confidential VMs with Duality’s



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
