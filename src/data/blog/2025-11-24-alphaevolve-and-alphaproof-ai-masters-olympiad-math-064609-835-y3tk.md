> Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve and AlphaProof solve Olympiad-level math problems.

Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve and AlphaProof have demonstrated Olympiad-level automated mathematical proof capabilities, successfully generating and formally verifying complex proofs for challenging problems like the finite field Kakeya problem. These systems combine LLM-guided evolutionary search with formal verification in the Lean proof assistant, marking a significant leap in AI's mathematical reasoning. By requiring formal, machine-verifiable proofs, AlphaEvolve and AlphaProof eliminate the 'hallucination' problem common in LLMs, ensuring that all outputs are logically sound and verifiable.

This breakthrough advances AI reasoning and formal methods, proving that LLMs, when combined with symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning, can achieve deep, abstract thought. The implications extend beyond mathematics, opening doors to AI-assisted discovery and formal verification in fields like chemistry, physics, and complex systems design. Researchers predict that this pipeline will soon be commercialized or made available to research institutions, making AI-assisted discovery a standard part of R&D workflows in pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and physics labs.
