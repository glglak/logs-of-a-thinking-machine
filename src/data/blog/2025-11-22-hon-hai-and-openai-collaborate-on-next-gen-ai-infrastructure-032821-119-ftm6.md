> Hon Hai and OpenAI partner to build advanced AI infrastructure and robot factories in the US.

Hon Hai Precision Industry (Foxconn) has announced a collaboration with OpenAI to develop next-generation AI infrastructure and strengthen its US supply chain. The partnership will focus on designing and producing advanced AI systems, with OpenAI providing insights into emerging hardware needs. Hon Hai plans to invest $1–5 billion to expand its US manufacturing footprint, aiming to assemble up to 2,000 server racks per week, doubling its current output.

Additionally, Hon Hai is forming a joint venture with Intrinsic, an Alphabet subsidiary, to build AI-powered robot factories. The collaboration will introduce automation solutions for electronic assembly, logistics, and machine maintenance, leveraging Intrinsic's Vision Model and general-purpose toolkit. The goal is to achieve full factory orchestration and automation, transforming manufacturing and automotive production. This partnership is expected to drive a 'step change' in efficiency and versatility, positioning Hon Hai at the forefront of AI-enabled industrial innovation.
