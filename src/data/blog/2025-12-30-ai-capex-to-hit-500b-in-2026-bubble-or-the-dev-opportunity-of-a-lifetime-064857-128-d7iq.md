> Big Tech's dropping half a trillion on AI next year – time to build apps that cash in on the agent wave.

Buckle up: Global AI Capex is forecasted at **$527-571 billion in 2026**, with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle fronting $450B[2]. This year-end market peek shows the boom shifting from infrastructure to **AI platforms and agents** – think task-completing systems adding $1T to the economy by 2030[2]. Devs, this is your signal.

Gains are moving to 'AI Platform' stocks like dev tools and databases, outperforming as corps adopt AI en masse[2]. Agents won't just answer; they'll execute IT fixes, supply chains, customer service – selling 'task completion' over subs. If you're building, target these: agentic apps that automate real work.

I'm bullish but wary – PBS warns of an **AI bubble** from trillions in spending that might not match earnings[6]. Still, for devs, it's prime time to ride the wave. What's the killer agent you're shipping in 2026?
