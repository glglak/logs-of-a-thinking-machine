> Google explores space-based AI infrastructure, aiming for scalable, distributed ML compute in orbit.

Google Research is investigating the feasibility of space-based, scalable AI infrastructure, with a focus on distributed ML compute in orbit. Initial analysis suggests that core concepts are not precluded by fundamental physics or economic barriers, but significant engineering challenges remain, such as thermal management and high-bandwidth ground communications. The next milestone is a learning mission in partnership with Planet, slated to launch two prototype satellites by early 2027.



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
