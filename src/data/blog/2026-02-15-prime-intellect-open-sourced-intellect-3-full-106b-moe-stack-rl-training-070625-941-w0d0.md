> 106B MoE model dominating math/code + they released the ENTIRE training stack—your custom RL agent era starts now.

Ever wished you could peek under the hood of a top reasoning model? Prime Intellect just handed you the keys: **INTELLECT-3**, a 106B Mixture-of-Experts beast crushing benchmarks in math, code, and reasoning via massive-scale reinforcement learning.[1]

They didn't stop at weights—they open-sourced the **full training stack**: environments, code, everything. This 106B MoE excels where it counts, trained with RLVR trends dominating 2025 (per Raschka's review), making 'benchmaxxing' accessible to indie devs and startups.[1]

Why care? Developers get **reproducible reasoning** for custom agents—no more black-box fine-tunes. Build math solvers, code gen tools, or science sims with verifiable RL rewards. It's a game-changer for workflows needing explainable AI, like devops automation or research prototyping.

Against OLMo 3 (Allen AI's 32B open reasoning king) or DeepSeek, INTELLECT-3's RL focus and full stack transparency win for serious builders. OLMo shines on base tasks, but lacks this depth in training artifacts.[1] Competitive edge: China's labs distill rivals, but Prime empowers the open ecosystem.[4]

Download from primeintellect.ai, spin up a training run on your cluster, and ask: can you beat their benchmarks with your data?
