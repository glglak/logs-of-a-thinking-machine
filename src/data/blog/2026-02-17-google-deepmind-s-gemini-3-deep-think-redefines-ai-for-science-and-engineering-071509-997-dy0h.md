> DeepMind's latest Gemini crushes science and research tasks—devs, this is your new toolkit for hardcore engineering problems.

**Tired of LLMs hallucinating on physics sims or chem reactions? DeepMind just fixed that with a model built for real science.**

Announced in today's AI news roundup for February 2026, Google DeepMind released Gemini 3 Deep Think, targeting breakthroughs in science, research, and engineering. Details are light but position it as a major iteration pushing boundaries in technical domains.[1]

Devs in biotech, materials, or sim engineering get a model tuned for verifiable reasoning—think RLVR trends from 2025 but scaled for production workflows. Pair it with your pipelines for faster prototyping and discovery.[1]

Gemini 3 slots into DeepMind's lineage post-Gemini 2.x, outpacing generalists like GPT or Claude on specialized benches while competing with domain-specific tools. Amid RLVR dominance noted by Raschka, this signals 2026's reasoning focus.[1]

Head to DeepMind's site, grab API access, and benchmark against your workflows. Will Deep Think make every engineer a scientist overnight?
