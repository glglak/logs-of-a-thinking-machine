> A Chinese startup claims their upcoming V4 model beats GPT and Claude on coding – and handles massive prompts like a boss.

You know how we're all waiting for the next big coding copilot? Buckle up, because DeepSeek from China just dropped a bomb: their V4 model, coming mid-February, allegedly smokes Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT series in internal coding tests.[1] What makes this wild? It's not just hype – they've cracked handling *extremely long coding prompts*, perfect for those sprawling enterprise projects where context is king.

As a dev, this hits home. Imagine feeding an entire codebase into an AI without it choking – DeepSeek's Engram training method lets them do it on cheaper chips too. No more $100k GPU farms just to experiment. China's closing the gap fast, and if V4 lives up to the buzz, it could flip the script on who dominates dev tools.[1]

My take? Test it day one. Open-source vibes from DeepSeek mean we might get free superpowers. But watch for biases or security holes in non-Western models. Who's ready to ditch Cursor for this?
