> Google plans $40B investment in three Texas data centers to boost AI computing power.

Google is investing $40 billion in three new Texas data centers, part of a massive push to expand its AI infrastructure. The investment will significantly increase the company’s computing capacity, supporting its AI and cloud businesses as demand for AI-driven services surges. Texas is emerging as a central hub for AI data centers, attracting similar investments from competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic.

The expansion includes funding for local workforce development through Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund, supporting electrical apprenticeships. The scale of spending—over $90 billion in capital expenditures this year—reflects Google’s ambition to lead in AI and cloud computing, while also raising questions about the long-term return on such massive infrastructure investments. The move underscores the growing importance of physical infrastructure in the AI race.
