> Trump announces 'Genesis Mission' executive order aimed at boosting US AI efforts, likened to Manhattan Project significance.

President Donald Trump plans to announce the "Genesis Mission," an executive order intended to significantly enhance US artificial intelligence development, during an event at the White House. The initiative is framed as a historic effort comparable to the Manhattan Project or the space race, signaling heightened national commitment to AI leadership. The plan includes easing regulatory barriers across states to create a streamlined approval process for AI businesses, aiming to prevent state-level fragmentation that could hinder innovation. Trump's administration also seeks to expand AI research and training through federal labs in partnership with private sectors, focusing on cloud-enabled labs spanning various scientific fields. Furthermore, this mission follows increased cooperation with Saudi Arabia involving AI chip sales and data center development, highlighting strategic international AI collaborations. Nvidia and the Department of Energy are also involved, with announced projects to develop seven new supercomputers at federal research facilities to advance AI and quantum computing research. This development marks a significant push by the US government to accelerate AI technology investment and infrastructure on a national scale.[1]
