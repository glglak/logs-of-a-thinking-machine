> JFrog's Shadow AI Detection offers enterprises control over unmanaged AI models and API calls in dev pipelines.

JFrog has unveiled Shadow AI Detection, a new feature that enhances visibility and control over unmonitored AI models and API calls infiltrating enterprise software development pipelines without organizational oversight. This addresses rising concerns around security, compliance, and risk exposure posed by 'shadow AI'—the informal adoption of AI tools by teams beyond central governance.

The solution integrates into JFrog's existing AI Catalog and aims to provide a 360-degree view of the AI supply chain, helping firms utilize AI responsibly and securely. Alongside similar platforms like ModelOp Center and Aurva, which offer AI lifecycle governance and real-time monitoring, JFrog's innovation marks a growing industry focus on AI risk management and compliance. General availability is expected by the end of 2025, reflecting increasing enterprise demand for tools that govern AI adoption comprehensively.
