![China's AI Explosion: 700+ Models Registered and Ready to Disrupt Globally](https://news.aibase.com/news/24030)

> China just hit 700 registered gen AI models—embodied bots in factories, agents everywhere. West, take note.

China's wrapping up its 14th Five-Year Plan with a bang: over 700 large-scale generative AI models registered nationwide, from language to multimodal and industry-specific beasts. They're shifting from wild growth to 'compliant prosperity'—regulated, practical, and scaling fast into logistics, manufacturing, and agents.[3]

For developers, this means real-world AI isn't sci-fi anymore. Embodied intelligence (think robots with smarts) and agent tech are hitting factories and inspections. HarmonyOS provides the secure base, pushing China from digital user to AI powerhouse. If you're in supply chain or hardware, Chinese models could undercut costs while matching capability.[3]

Honest opinion: The West obsesses over frontier models, but China's volume + compliance = enterprise dominance. US devs, integrate agent frameworks now or get left behind. Looking at the 15th Plan, expect self-reliant AI flooding global markets. Building embodied AI? What's your play against this tidal wave?
