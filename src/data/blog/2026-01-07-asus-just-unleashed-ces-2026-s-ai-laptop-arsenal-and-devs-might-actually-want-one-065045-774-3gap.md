> ASUS dropped AI-packed ExpertBooks and MyExpert at CES that could supercharge your dev workflow on the go.

CES 2026 kicked off with ASUS flexing a full AI commercial lineup, and honestly, these ExpertBook Ultras and MyExperts look like dev dream machines—not just hypeware.[4] Think AMD Ryzen AI chips, Intel Core Ultra, and an all-in-one platform with AI Chat, Knowledge Hub, auto-meeting notes, and instant file search. For hybrid workers, it's productivity nitro.

Why care as a coder? Local AI acceleration means running models without cloud bills—fine-tune small LLMs on-device, debug with AI Writer, or query your codebase via RAG-like search. I've lugged heavy rigs to cafes; these whisper-quiet, secure B-series laptops with Ryzen AI could end that pain, boosting offline tinkering.

Practical move: Watch for ExpertBook P5 G2 benchmarks on MLPerf. If they deliver, snag one for your stack. Limitation: Enterprise pricing might sting. Ready to ditch your power-hungry beast for AI-native hardware?
