> Meta just unveiled their most advanced AI glasses ever, pushing superintelligence right onto your face in 2025's highlight reel.

Meta's year-end flex today isn't subtle: superintelligence vision, beefed-up teen protections, and AI glasses that could make AR dev explode. Forget bulky headsets – these are sleek, everyday wearables packing breakthrough AI smarts.[2]

Why care as a coder? Because Meta's stacking the deck for on-device LLMs that run multimodal AI (vision + voice + context) without phoning home. Devs, think custom AR overlays via their APIs, real-time code assistance projected on your glasses during pair programming. It's the hardware bridge to ambient computing we've been hacking with prototypes.[2]

Honest take: Hype is real here, but paired with their superintelligence push, expect SDK drops soon. Pair it with Llama models for edge AI wins – lower latency, no cloud bills spiking. Who's grabbing dev kits day one? How will you build your first glasses app?[2]
