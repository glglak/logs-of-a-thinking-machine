> Red Hat CTO Chris Wright doubles down on open AI - because closed models are a dev's nightmare waiting to happen.

Picture this: You're knee-deep in hybrid cloud AI, locked into proprietary black boxes that break your sovereignty. Red Hat CTO Chris Wright just reminded us why 'default to open' is non-negotiable for AI.

In today's update, Wright hammers home how open ecosystems crush complexity, boost responsible innovation, and turn AI into a dev superpower - all while eyeing the data layer as the real game-changer. No more vendor lock-in; think flexible, secure AI that scales with your stack.

As devs, this matters because we're the ones gluing it all together. Open AI means faster iteration, better debugging, and actual control. Red Hat's not just talking - their 2026 vision is agentic AI on unified platforms. Are you still betting on closed? Time to switch.
