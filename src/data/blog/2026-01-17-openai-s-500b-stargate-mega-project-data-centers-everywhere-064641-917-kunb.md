> OpenAI just unveiled five new data center sites in their insane $500B Stargate push with Oracle and SoftBank.

Picture this: OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank dropping $500 billion on AI infrastructure over four years, with *five new data centers* announced this week.[1] Stargate isn't some sci-fi flick – it's the backbone for next-gen models, backed by energy deals like the one with SB Energy on Jan 8.

For developers, this means cheaper, faster inference down the line. No more API wait times killing your prototype. But it's a power-hungry beast – think grids straining under GPU thirst. If you're building AI apps, this scales your dreams, but pray for sustainable energy or we're all screwed.[1]

Honest opinion: Love the ambition, hate the hype. Stargate could democratize AI compute, but only if indies get access beyond big corps. Devs, start planning multi-cloud now – who's betting on edge cases blowing budgets?
