_METIUS project uses AI for evidence synthesis._

The METIUS project, led by Queen’s University Belfast, is a five-year initiative aimed at revolutionizing evidence synthesis using AI. With a £11.5 million investment, METIUS will combine AI with human expertise to speed up and improve the relevance of scientific evidence for policymakers. This project focuses on tackling urgent challenges across education, justice, climate, and international development. By leveraging AI, METIUS seeks to enhance the accessibility and timeliness of evidence delivery, thereby supporting better decision-making.
