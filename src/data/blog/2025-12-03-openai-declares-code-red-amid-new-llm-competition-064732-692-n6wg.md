> OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declares 'code red' as rivals launch new LLMs, accelerating internal development.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a 'code red' in a recent internal memo, signaling a state of urgency as competitors like Google and Anthropic release new flagship large language models. The memo, shared with employees, emphasizes that OpenAI is redirecting resources to accelerate the development of its next-generation reasoning model, aiming to outperform rivals such as Google's Gemini 3 and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5. Altman stressed the importance of improving ChatGPT's speed, reliability, and personalization, while also broadening its question-answering capabilities.

This strategic shift comes after Google's rapid rollout of Gemini 3, which set records on tough math and programming benchmarks, and Anthropic's release of Claude Opus 4.5, touted as the world's best coding model. OpenAI is reportedly pausing or delaying other projects—including a personal assistant and AI agents for healthcare and shopping—to focus on its core LLM and ChatGPT enhancements. The company is expected to release its new model next week, aiming to regain its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
