> Meta's new 'Compute' division bets everything on AI infra, laying off Reality Labs to chase gigawatts of power.

Zuckerberg just lit $600 billion on fire—by 2028—for 'Meta Compute,' a massive push to build tens of gigawatts of AI capacity. Reality Labs? Slashed with layoffs. The Metaverse dream is toast; AI infrastructure is the new king. This isn't hype; it's a total pivot to owning the compute wars.[1]

Devs, this changes everything for scaling LLMs. Meta's going all-in on raw power, which means cheaper, faster inference for open models like Llama. If you're training or deploying at scale, watch for their hardware drops—they're building the backbone we'll all lean on. But $600B? That's Nvidia-level ambition, and with layoffs signaling focus, expect open-source gold soon.[1]

My opinion: Brilliant move. VR flopped, but AI infra wins wars. Pair this with Microsoft's 'Good Neighbor' data center pledges (no rate hikes, water replenishment), and Big Tech is solving the power crunch that kills startups. Who's ready to build on Meta's next Llama? What's your wildest AI infra prediction?
