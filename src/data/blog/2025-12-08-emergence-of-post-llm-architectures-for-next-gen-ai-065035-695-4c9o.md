> Post-LLM architectures combine LLMs with new techniques to surpass current limitations and enable versatile AI.

Post-LLM architectures represent an important development beyond today’s large language models (LLMs) like GPT and BERT. These new frameworks aim to overcome inherent limitations such as fixed context windows, interpretability challenges, and high resource demands. Key innovations include modular hybrid models which integrate LLMs with reasoning engines or knowledge graphs, memory-augmented networks to extend context, multimodal systems that handle vision and audio alongside language, and more efficient training mechanisms like sparse attention. By evolving the LLM paradigm, these architectures promise AI that is smarter, more reliable, and applicable across complex domains ranging from real-time dialogue to scientific discovery. This innovation is critical as AI systems become increasingly central to technology and society, addressing both capability and sustainability.
