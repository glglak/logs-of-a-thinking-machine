> Meta's blockbuster acquisition of Manus AI isn't just cash—it's their bet on AI that actually *does* the work.

Whoa, Meta didn't just buy a company—they secured the future of AI execution. Dropping $3 billion on Singapore's Manus AI right as it hits $100 million ARR? That's not hype; that's a signal that Zuck is all-in on the 'doing' layer of AI, not just chatty LLMs.[1]

As developers, this hits home hard. Manus AI specializes in turning AI from talkers into doers—think autonomous agents handling real workflows. If you're still building prompt chains in LangChain, wake up: Meta now owns the tech to make agents that execute end-to-end, from ideation to deployment. This could flood the ecosystem with open-sourced agent frameworks, slashing your build time for production apps.

But here's my hot take: it's a defensive play against OpenAI's agent push. Expect Meta's Llama models to get 'Manus-powered' superpowers soon, making them viable for enterprise without the API bills. Devs, start experimenting with agentic stacks now—before your job becomes 'overseeing the AI takeover'. What agent are you building first?
