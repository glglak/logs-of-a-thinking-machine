> Allen Institute for AI releases Olmo 3, offering full access to model lifecycle for open experimentation.

The Allen Institute for AI has launched Olmo 3, a new family of open-source language models that provide unprecedented transparency into the entire model development process. Unlike most LLMs, which only release final weights, Olmo 3 exposes reasoning traces, datasets, and post-training artifacts, enabling developers to inspect, modify, and experiment with every stage of the model’s lifecycle. This includes the ability to trace outputs back to training data and test new reinforcement learning objectives.

At the core is Olmo 3-Think (32B), a reasoning-focused model that excels in multi-step reasoning tasks and matches or outperforms leading open-weight models like Qwen 3 and Gemma 3. The 7B variants are optimized for coding, math, and instruction-following, and can run on modest hardware. The release supports diverse post-training pathways—Instruct for chat, Think for reasoning, and RL Zero for research—making it highly adaptable. All models, datasets, and artifacts are permissively licensed, encouraging open research, education, and applied AI projects. The community response has been enthusiastic, noting rapid progress and the potential for truly open-source AI to rival proprietary models.
