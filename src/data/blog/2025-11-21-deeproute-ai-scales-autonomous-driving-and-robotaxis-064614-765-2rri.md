> DeepRoute.ai delivers 200,000 autonomous vehicles and launches robotaxi services by year-end.

DeepRoute.ai has announced it will deliver autonomous driving platforms for over 200,000 production vehicles by the end of 2025, marking a major milestone in the commercialization of autonomous driving technology. The company is also launching robotaxi operations using consumer-grade vehicles, expanding its reach into commercial mobility services. This achievement demonstrates the scalability and safety of DeepRoute.ai’s autonomous solutions.

DeepRoute.ai’s technology is built on a unified framework supporting consumer vehicles, robotaxis, and RoadAGI—a general-purpose autonomous intelligence system. RoadAGI enables intelligent agents to navigate complex environments and make independent decisions, with applications in logistics, property management, healthcare, and security. The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model underpinning DeepRoute IO 2.0 integrates visual perception, semantic understanding, and autonomous decision-making, supporting both current deployments and future high-autonomy applications.
