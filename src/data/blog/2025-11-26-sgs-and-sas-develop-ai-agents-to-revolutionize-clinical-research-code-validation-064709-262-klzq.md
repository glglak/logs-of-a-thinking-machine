> SGS and SAS partner to cut manual review time using LLM AI agents for clinical trial data validation.

SGS and SAS have announced a collaboration to create AI-powered agents designed to improve code validation in clinical research by drastically reducing manual reviews. Clinical trial data validation is crucial but can be costly and time-consuming due to needed expert oversight despite existing automated tools like Pinnacle21. The newly developed LLM-based AI agents learn from context and examples to streamline the validation process while maintaining strict data confidentiality within secure environments. This innovation promises accelerated clinical workflows, improved data quality, and cost reductions, with aspirations to support the entire drug submission lifecycle from raw data to regulatory reporting. The collaboration exemplifies how combining domain expertise with cutting-edge AI technology can yield practical advancements in life sciences data management.
