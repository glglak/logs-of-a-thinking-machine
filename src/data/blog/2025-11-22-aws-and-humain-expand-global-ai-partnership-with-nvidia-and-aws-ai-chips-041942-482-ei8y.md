> AWS and HUMAIN partner to deploy 150,000 NVIDIA and Trainium AI accelerators powering global AI innovation.

AWS and HUMAIN have expanded their partnership to deploy up to 150,000 AI accelerators, incorporating NVIDIA's latest GB300 AI infrastructure alongside AWS’s Trainium AI chips, aiming to accelerate global AI innovation and computing capabilities. This collaboration includes establishing a pioneering AI Zone in Saudi Arabia that supports intensive AI training and inference workloads, facilitating rapid transition from AI concept to production with seamless integration of NVIDIA and AWS technologies.

The AI Zone will serve both Saudi Arabia's national AI ambitions and the increasing global demand for advanced AI compute resources. Customers will gain immediate access to Amazon’s advanced generative AI services such as Amazon Bedrock, AgentCore, and SageMaker, which abstract infrastructure management and enable model deployment across diverse workloads. AWS becoming HUMAIN's preferred AI partner marks a strategic move to build an extensive AI ecosystem fostering innovation and global market expansion in AI infrastructure and services.
