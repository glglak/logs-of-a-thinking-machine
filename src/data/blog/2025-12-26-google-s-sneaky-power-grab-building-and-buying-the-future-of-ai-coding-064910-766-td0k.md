> Google dropped a Cursor-killer tool *right after* pumping billions into Cursor—what game are they playing?

Picture this: You're knee-deep in 'vibe coding' with Cursor, the AI editor that's changing how we build apps. Then bam—Google unleashes Antigravity, their slick new dev tool aimed straight at Cursor's throat. Oh, and this all happens days after Google Ventures drops cash on Cursor at a insane $29.3B valuation. It's like they're hedging bets while stacking the deck.[1]

As a dev, this hits hard. Google now eyes owning the IDE (Antigravity), runtime via Cursor investments, and even design tools. Anthropic snags Bun, the JS runtime powering billion-dollar coding assistants. We're seeing Big Tech consolidate: control the stack from code to deployment. No more fragmented tools—it's vertical integration on steroids, and it could lock us into their ecosystems faster than you can say 'vendor lock-in'.[1]

My take? Exciting for polished tools, terrifying for choice. If you're building AI apps, watch who owns your runtime. Start experimenting with Antigravity now before it dominates. Who's winning the coding wars in your stack?
