> Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 sets new benchmarks for coding and agentic tasks with aggressive pricing.

On November 24, 2025, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5, its latest flagship large language model, positioning it as the world's most powerful model for coding, agents, and computer use. The release marks a significant leap in AI's practical applicability to software development, with enhanced coding capabilities validated by leading benchmarks. Opus 4.5 features a 200,000-token context window, a 64,000-token output limit, and a March 2025 knowledge cutoff, making it highly competitive for complex engineering tasks. Anthropic also introduced a new 'effort' parameter, allowing users to balance response speed and quality, and a 'zoom' tool for detailed screen inspection, further boosting its utility for developers.

Beyond raw performance, Opus 4.5 is notable for its dramatically reduced cost structure, democratizing access to frontier AI for a broader range of developers and enterprises. The model's specialization in agentic tasks signals a move toward more autonomous and intelligent AI systems capable of complex decision-making and tool interaction. This development is not just an incremental upgrade but a watershed moment in AI's evolution, where models are transitioning from assistive roles to genuinely collaborative and leading roles in software creation.
