![Anthropic's Claude 4 Sneak Peek: 2M Token Context That Actually Works](https://example.com/claude4-context.jpg)

> Claude 4 just demoed handling 2 million tokens without forgetting - goodbye to context window nightmares.

Picture this: you're building an AI agent that needs to reason over your entire codebase, docs, and commit history in one go. Anthropic's Claude 4 preview today makes that real with a 2M token context window that doesn't crumble under pressure. No more 'sorry, I forgot the first part' errors that plague every other model.

For developers, this is game-changing for RAG apps, long-form analysis, and enterprise deployments where data sprawl is real. They showed it summarizing 500-page PDFs while cross-referencing code snippets flawlessly. My hot take? This obsoletes most vector DB hacks we've been building.

But let's be real - massive context sounds cool, but compute costs could kill it for side projects. Still, if priced right, it's a must-test for anyone shipping AI products. Who's firing up their API keys first? Tell me in the comments what you'd stuff into 2M tokens.
