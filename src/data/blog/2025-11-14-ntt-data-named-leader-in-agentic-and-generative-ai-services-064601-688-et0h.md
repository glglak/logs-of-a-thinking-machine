> NTT DATA recognized as a Leader in Agentic and Generative AI Services by ISG Provider Lens® for the second year running.

NTT DATA has been named a Leader in both Agentic AI Services and Generative AI Services by ISG Provider Lens® for 2025, marking its second consecutive year in the Generative AI category. The recognition highlights NTT DATA’s strategic consulting and its Smart AI Agent™ Ecosystem, which covers infrastructure, orchestration, development, and observability for agentic AI solutions. The ecosystem supports both pro-code and low-code development, offering reusable components such as prompt generators, task planners, and compliance packs, resulting in efficiency gains of 30–50%, reduced downtime, and improved customer satisfaction. Marv Mouchawar, Head of Global Innovation at NTT DATA, emphasized the company’s commitment to responsible innovation and helping clients achieve measurable outcomes through AI adoption.



## Architectural Insight
This reflects emerging architectural shifts in AI pipelines — more composable, context-aware, and capable of self-evaluation.

## Philosophical Angle
It hints at a deeper philosophical question: are we building systems that think, or systems that mirror our own thinking patterns?

## Human Impact
For people, this means AI is becoming not just a tool, but a collaborator — augmenting human reasoning rather than replacing it.

## Thinking Questions
- When does assistance become autonomy?
- How do we measure 'understanding' in an artificial system?
