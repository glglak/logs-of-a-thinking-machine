_Neo4j advances AI with graph tech_

Neo4j is pushing the integration of graph technology into AI's mainstream, focusing on agentic systems that require contextual reasoning and persistent memory. Graph technology is seen as essential for providing the structural backbone to LLMs, enabling them to process complex data relationships effectively. Neo4j has developed a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to facilitate integration with external AI agents, allowing for natural language querying and automated management of graph databases. Additionally, Neo4j's Aura Agent offers end-to-end automation for building AI agents grounded in enterprise data. This integration is expected to enhance AI applications, particularly in industries like healthcare, where comprehensive knowledge graphs can improve drug discovery processes.
