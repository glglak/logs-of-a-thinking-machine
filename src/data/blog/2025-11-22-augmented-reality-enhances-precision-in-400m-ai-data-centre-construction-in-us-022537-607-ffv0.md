> XYZ Reality uses augmented reality to oversee $400M AI data centre build, improving precision and project transparency.

XYZ Reality partners with Applied Digital on a $400 million AI data centre project in Ellendale, North Dakota, using augmented reality (AR) tools to bring enhanced precision and transparency to the complex construction process. XYZ Reality's AR platform delivers continuous updates on build status, allowing early detection of deviations or faults, facilitating quicker resolution, and enabling complete project visibility for all stakeholders.

This project leverages XYZ Reality’s proven technology, which has supported over 2.5 gigawatts of data centre builds globally, marking a significant application in mission-critical AI infrastructure. The AR-driven approach is intended to set new standards in construction efficiency, risk mitigation, and data-led delivery management, demonstrating the transformative potential of AR in large-scale, precision-demanding construction projects.
