> Forget experiments: These orgs are delivering measurable AI ROI across 30 countries - and applications are open.

**78% of enterprises run AI mission-critical now - but only pioneers scale it profitably.** The World Economic Forum dropped their new report yesterday on AI success stories, spotlighting the second MINDS cohort of 20 orgs nailing impact in healthcare, energy, robotics, and more[5].

*Proof over Promise* analyzes hundreds of cases from 30+ countries, revealing patterns for turning AI pilots into scaled wins. New pioneers tackle disease detection, energy optimization, supply-chain resilience - with full lists across IT, battery manufacturing, global health, and infrastructure[5]. Applications for cohort 3 are open now.

For devs and teams, **blueprints for enterprise AI ROI**: Learn from real deployments boosting efficiency in admin, diagnostics, and ops. Bridge the adoption gap with proven frameworks from Accenture collab[5].

Unlike vendor hype, MINDS focuses on **novel, deployable, compliant solutions** vetted by execs. Stands out amid 2025's eval frameworks and SLM rises, emphasizing measurable gains over potential[5][2].

**Apply to MINDS or audit your AI against their patterns today.** Dive the report for use cases - which sector's wins match your stack? This is the playbook for 2026 AI leadership.
