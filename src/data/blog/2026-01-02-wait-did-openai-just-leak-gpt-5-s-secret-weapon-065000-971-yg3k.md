> Rumors are flying about a massive context window upgrade that could finally kill RAG forever.

You wake up to Twitter exploding with screenshots from an alleged OpenAI internal doc. GPT-5 isn't just bigger - it's got a 10M token context window. That's not hype, that's a game-changer for every developer building AI apps.

As someone who's spent way too many hours hacking RAG pipelines together, this hits different. No more chunking your docs into tiny pieces or praying your vector DB doesn't choke. Imagine feeding entire codebases, legal docs, or company knowledge graphs in one shot. Retrieval errors? Gone. Hallucinations from context loss? Minimized. But here's the dev reality check: if this lands, your current stack needs an autopsy.

Practically speaking, start auditing your apps NOW. That Pinecone bill? Slashable. Those custom splitting strategies? Obsolete. OpenAI's playing 4D chess while we're still debugging embeddings. My hot take: this forces everyone to level up from 'prompt engineer' to 'system architect.'

Are you ready to ditch RAG, or is this just January vaporware?
