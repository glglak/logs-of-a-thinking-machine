> Meta's secret 'Avocado' AI model eyes spring 2026 closed-source release, potentially ending open Llama era—huge implications for startups relying on free LLMs. Latest industry shift revealed. (150 characters)

Whispers from the AI trenches: Meta is crafting 'Avocado,' a powerhouse model slated for spring 2026, but with a twist—it's reportedly veering closed-source, a stark pivot from the open Llama legacy that fueled global innovation[1].

Details are guarded, but reports peg it as a strategic response to intensifying competition, building on Llama's success while hoarding next-gen advancements in efficiency and multimodal capabilities. This comes amid Meta's massive compute investments, signaling bets on proprietary edges[1].

Startups and devs hooked on free Llama models face disruption—expect pricier access or forks, pushing enterprise toward vendor lock-in. Architects must reassess stacks: diversify to open alternatives or brace for Meta's premium tier[1].

Philosophically, this closed turn echoes the open-source dream's fracture—will Big Tech's vaults slow collective progress, or ignite a renaissance of indie models? As AI democratizes then recentralizes, balance hangs in the code.
