> Extract tables and formulas from messy PDFs at 100+ FPS—on consumer hardware. Z ai's 0.9B breakthrough is developer catnip.

**Tired of OCR tools that choke on tables or math equations, forcing you to manually retype everything?** Say goodbye to that hell with GLM-OCR.

Z ai launched GLM-OCR, a featherweight 0.9 billion parameter model that devours text, tables, and formulas from images and PDFs with scary accuracy and speed. It's optimized for edge devices, running inference blazingly fast even on low-power CPUs—no GPU required.[2]

For devs building RAG pipelines, data extraction apps, or document AI, this is gold. Parse invoices, research papers, or scanned contracts in seconds, feeding clean structured data straight into your LLM chain. Pair it with LlamaIndex or Haystack for instant production-grade document understanding.

Unlike heavyweight proprietary OCR like Google Vision (API-only, pricey), GLM-OCR is open and local-first. It crushes benchmarks on mixed-language docs while sipping resources—perfect vs. bloated alternatives like Tesseract upgrades or PaddleOCR. With RAG exploding, this fills a massive gap.[2]

Download from Hugging Face, test on your nastiest PDF, and integrate via Transformers. Watch for finetunes on niche domains; could this end cloud OCR bills forever?
