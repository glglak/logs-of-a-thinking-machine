> OpenAI's new Garlic model outperforms Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 in coding and reasoning, possibly launching as GPT-5.2 or 5.5.

OpenAI has reportedly developed a new large language model, codenamed Garlic, that is showing strong performance in internal benchmarks, often surpassing Google's Gemini 3 and Anthropic's Opus 4.5, especially in coding and reasoning tasks. This development comes after CEO Sam Altman declared a 'code red' to improve ChatGPT, with Garlic likely forming the core of OpenAI's next-generation offering. The model is distinct from another project called Shallotpeat but leverages improved pretraining methods and bug fixes discovered during that work. Early details suggest Garlic may be released as GPT-5.2 or GPT-5.5 early next year, signaling a strategic push to reclaim leadership in the competitive LLM landscape.

Garlic's architecture is notable for its advanced reasoning capabilities and efficient inference, supporting low-precision NVFP4 on modern GPUs like A100, H100, and Blackwell. It also handles multimodal inputs, including text, images, and multilingual content. The model's emergence highlights the rapid pace of innovation in foundational LLMs, with OpenAI aiming to deliver a product that not only matches but exceeds the capabilities of its rivals. This could have significant implications for developers, enterprises, and end-users relying on state-of-the-art AI for complex tasks.
