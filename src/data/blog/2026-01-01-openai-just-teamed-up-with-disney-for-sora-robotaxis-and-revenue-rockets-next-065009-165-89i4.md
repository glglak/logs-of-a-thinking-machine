> OpenAI's Disney deal could explode Sora's appeal, while their revenue chase hits $30B - but will agents deliver?

Hold up, OpenAI signing an exclusive Disney licensing deal for Sora? That's the kind of move that turns 'cool tech demo' into 'must-use app for every dev and creator.' Imagine generating videos of yourself chilling with Iron Man or Luke Skywalker - lame fake celeb vids suddenly feel epic. This isn't just hype; it's a signal that multimedia AI is going mainstream in 2026, and as devs, we're about to see APIs flood with video gen tools that actually matter.[1]

But the real tea is the revenue predictions: OpenAI aiming for $30B in 2026, Anthropic right behind, fueled by gigawatt clusters and LLM coding agents speeding up dev cycles. I've been skeptical of scaling laws hitting walls, but if agents keep boosting productivity, this could mean cheaper, faster models for all of us building apps. Tesla's robotaxi push in Austin and SF? Self-driving AI is eating ridesharing - time to integrate those APIs into your logistics side projects.[1]

My take: This combo of video + agents + autonomy is developer catnip. But diminishing returns on RL? Watch for open-source challengers catching up. Who's betting OpenAI hits that revenue mark - and will it trickle down to our inference costs? Drop your predictions below.
