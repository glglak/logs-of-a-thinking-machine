> Microsoft introduces new observability tools for GenAI apps and agents in Azure.

Microsoft has launched new observability capabilities for generative AI applications and agents within Azure Monitor and AI Foundry. These tools provide end-to-end visibility across the AI stack, allowing organizations to monitor not just system uptime and speed, but also the accuracy, safety, and cost-efficiency of AI agent responses. Features include a unified dashboard for agent metrics, AI-tailored trace views, and advanced search capabilities for GenAI-specific attributes.

The solution leverages OpenTelemetry innovations to capture multi-agent orchestration traces, LLM reasoning context, and evaluation signals. This enables interoperability with partner tools and supports a holistic approach to monitoring and optimizing GenAI deployments. The new observability suite is designed to help enterprises trust and manage their AI systems more effectively as generative AI becomes integral to business operations.
