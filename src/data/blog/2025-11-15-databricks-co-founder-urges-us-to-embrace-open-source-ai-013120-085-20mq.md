> Databricks co-founder warns US must go open source to compete with China in AI research.

Databricks co-founder Andy Konwinski has issued a stark warning that the US is losing its AI research dominance to China and must immediately shift to open source development to maintain its lead. Speaking at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit, Konwinski highlighted that Chinese companies are outproducing American labs in breakthrough AI research, creating an existential threat to democracy. He emphasized that the US's proprietary approach is draining talent from universities and stifling the collaborative scientific ecosystem that led to foundational AI breakthroughs. In contrast, China's government policies actively encourage open source development, fostering rapid innovation. Konwinski's call for open source is a fundamental shift in how Silicon Valley's power brokers view the global AI race, urging American labs to abandon their closed-door mentality to remain competitive.
