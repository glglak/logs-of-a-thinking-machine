> New LLM observability tools offer prompt injection protection and data poisoning prevention.

Recent advancements in LLM observability have introduced new tools designed to protect AI systems from prompt injection attacks and data poisoning. These security measures are critical as enterprises increasingly deploy LLMs in production environments. Prompt injection protection guards against malicious inputs that degrade model output quality, while data poisoning prevention insulates models from adversaries attempting to manipulate training data.

The tools are part of a broader suite that includes LLM experiments and playgrounds, providing developers with safe environments to build, iterate, and test AI-powered applications. Integration with major platforms like Cursor, OpenAI, and Anthropic enables seamless use within developer workflows. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) further enhances observability by allowing autonomous agents to fetch context from diverse sources, accelerating root cause analysis. These developments reflect growing industry focus on securing and monitoring LLM deployments as adoption accelerates.
