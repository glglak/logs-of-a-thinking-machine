**What if AI didn't just analyze data, but invented new plastics and batteries from scratch?** MIT's Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli calls this the dawn of general scientific intelligence via multimodal LLMs.[1][7]

His lab blends physics sims, ML, and gen AI for fully computational workflows: high-throughput data generation improves models, which prioritize experiments for partners in OLEDs, catalysts, and more. He's spun out companies to commercialize.[1][7]

For devs: build tools that chain sims + VLMs for end-to-end discovery—prototype materials in hours, not years. Accelerate your chem-eng, energy, or pharma stacks with 'AI chemists'.[1]

Beats siloed tools like AlphaFold (proteins-only) by reasoning multimodally over recipes/structures/text, aligning with JAIST's knowledge fusion for broader domains. Science's ChatGPT moment.[1][2]

**Fork his open tools on GitHub, pair with PySCF for sims—ready to design your first AI catalyst?** Watch for startup acquisitions; this shifts science from hypothesis to hyperscale.[1][7]
