> Sandia adds AI exploration to New Mexico Electric Car Challenge, linking STEM education with real-world AI energy analysis.

The New Mexico Electric Car Challenge, sponsored by Sandia National Laboratories, is introducing artificial intelligence elements to inspire middle school students through hands-on STEM education. This year, participants will investigate and compare energy consumption of electric vehicles alongside AI models like ChatGPT and the data centers supporting them. Sandia’s K-12 STEM program aims to deepen students’ understanding of both AI and electric vehicle technology, encouraging innovation and practical problem-solving aligned with the presidential AI challenge. In addition to racing and design activities, AI experts from Sandia will demonstrate machine learning and virtual reality projects, exposing students to cutting-edge AI applications in an engaging environment. This integration bridges AI knowledge with engineering challenges, fostering early interest in AI-driven energy solutions and technology development.
