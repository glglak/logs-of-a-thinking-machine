> Zuck's new 'Meta Compute' plan drops tens of gigawatts of AI power – is this the infrastructure devs have been begging for?

Mark Zuckerberg just unveiled 'Meta Compute,' Meta's decade-long crusade to build tens of gigawatts of AI infra. That's not hype; it's $600B+ in data centers by 2028, led by ex-Google execs, chasing superintelligence. As a dev, this screams opportunity – open-ish access to massive compute could level the playing field against closed giants.

Practical angle: Meta's Hyperion datacenters and Scale AI stake mean cheaper, faster training for your LLMs. Forget begging for GPU time; this could flood the market with Llama-powered tools, integrations, and agentic workflows. But watch the energy bill – it's a dev's dream until your electric rates spike.

Honest opinion: Zuckerberg's playing 4D chess here, partnering with governments for scale no solo dev can touch. If you're building on open models, this is your green light. Who's jumping on Meta's AI train first?
