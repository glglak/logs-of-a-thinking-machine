> OpenAI releases GPT-5.1 with dynamic thinking, faster responses, and tools for coding and reasoning.

OpenAI has introduced GPT-5.1, the latest iteration in the GPT-5 series, designed to enhance developer experience with improved intelligence and speed. This model dynamically adjusts its thinking time according to task complexity, enabling faster and more token-efficient processing. For example, simple queries can bypass the reasoning process with a new "no reasoning" mode, delivering quick answers without the overhead of deep inference. Additionally, GPT-5.1 introduces extended prompt caching for 24-hour retention and new API tools like 'apply_patch' and 'shell' to facilitate agentic and coding tasks.

This release reflects OpenAI's focus on balancing performance with practical application, especially in software engineering contexts where rapid, reliable responses are critical. The improvements also aim to support developers by making the model more flexible and context-aware. GPT-5.1 will be integrated into products such as Microsoft Copilot Chat, which uses GPT-5's real-time model routing for tailored response speeds and reasoning depth, highlighting industry adoption of advanced LLM capabilities in productivity tools.[1][2]
