> AI achieves 93% accuracy in cancer detection via RNA sequencing, showcased at AMP 2025.

At the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) 2025 Annual Meeting, researchers unveiled an AI classifier that achieves 93% diagnostic accuracy for cancer detection using RNA sequencing. Developed by The Hospital for Sick Children, the platform is designed to handle heterogeneous datasets and integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows, enabling preoperative prediction of tumor mutations and personalized treatment plans.

Separately, Augusta University researchers presented a computational framework that fuses imaging and genomic data, allowing AI to extract molecular-level tumor information directly from standard H&E-stained slides—eliminating the need for costly genetic testing. These advances mark a pivotal shift toward precision medicine, empowering clinicians with actionable insights and improving patient outcomes through more informed, personalized care.
