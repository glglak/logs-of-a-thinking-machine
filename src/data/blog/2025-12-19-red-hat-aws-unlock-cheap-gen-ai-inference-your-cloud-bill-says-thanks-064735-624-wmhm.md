> Red Hat teams with AWS on Trainium chips to make enterprise gen AI scalable and wallet-friendly.

Gen AI in prod? Costs exploding faster than your prompts. Red Hat's fresh collab with AWS on Trainium and Inferentia changes that - optimized inference for hybrid clouds at scale.

This isn't hype; it's tools to run production-ready gen AI without melting your budget or infra. Enterprises get sovereignty, security, and speed across environments. For devs like us, it means deploying agentic workflows without the usual headaches.

Honest opinion: Finally, big players get it - open hybrid is king. Ditch the silos, embrace this for 2026. Who's firing up Trainium first?
