> AWS and HUMAIN team up to deploy 150,000 AI accelerators and establish a premier AI Zone in Saudi Arabia.

AWS and HUMAIN have expanded their partnership to accelerate global AI innovation by deploying up to 150,000 AI accelerators, including NVIDIA's latest GB300 AI infrastructure and AWS's Trainium chips. This collaboration positions AWS as HUMAIN's preferred AI partner worldwide and includes establishing an AI Zone in Saudi Arabia designed to support cutting-edge AI training and inference workloads. The AI Zone will cater to both Saudi Arabia's national AI ambitions and the increasing global demand for AI compute resources.

Through this partnership, customers gain seamless access to AWS's generative AI services like Amazon Bedrock, Amazon AgentCore, and Amazon SageMaker, enabling immediate use of leading foundation models without managing underlying infrastructure. HUMAIN's CEO highlighted the venture as a multi-gigawatt initiative combining innovation and a groundbreaking commercial model to shape future AI development, deployment, and scaling on a global basis, fueled by a robust compute ecosystem integrated with AWS and NVIDIA technologies.
