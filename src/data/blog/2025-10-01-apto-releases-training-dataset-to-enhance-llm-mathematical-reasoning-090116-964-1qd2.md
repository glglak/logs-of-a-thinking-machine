_APTO launches a dataset to improve LLM accuracy in multi-step math, addressing step omission and format errors in current models._

APTO has released a specialized training dataset aimed at enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. While LLMs have shown remarkable progress, they still struggle with multi-step calculations, strict answer formatting (such as integers or fractions), and frequently omit intermediate problem-solving steps. This dataset is designed to train models to output step-by-step solutions, adhere to required formats, and reduce errors in complex mathematical tasks, addressing a key challenge in the practical deployment of generative AI for technical domains[1].

The initiative responds to observed limitations where models either skip crucial reasoning steps or fail to follow instructions, resulting in incorrect or incomplete answers. By focusing on structured, process-oriented training data, APTO aims to close the gap between LLM capabilities and real-world mathematical problem-solving needs, supporting broader enterprise adoption where accuracy is critical[1].
