> Azure AI now powers 25%+ of Microsoft's cloud cash – new partner perks mean faster enterprise rollouts for you.

**Azure's AI revenue hit 25% of total last year and is doubling in 2026 – now Microsoft's supercharging partners to flood enterprises with your AI solutions.** The expanded AI Cloud Partner Program (Feb 2026) shifts from pilots to full deployments.[1]

Microsoft announced beefed-up benefits: co-sell incentives, technical skilling, and marketplace boosts for AI builders. With 40% YoY cloud growth, it's a flywheel – more infra utilization from AI workloads funds even bigger models.[1]

**Devs get paid to scale: list your OpenAI/GPT wrappers or custom agents on Azure Marketplace for instant enterprise reach.** No more cold-calling Fortune 500s – Microsoft's machine greases your go-to-market. Perfect for SMBs building RAG apps or fine-tunes.[1]

Beats AWS Bedrock's siloed models or GCP's complexity – Azure owns the OpenAI pipeline, now with partner velocity. Ties perfectly into today's frontier releases, letting you deploy GPT-5.3 or Claude on optimized infra.[1]

**Join the program at azure.microsoft.com/partners, certify your app, pitch co-sell. Track Azure OpenAI quotas spiking – ready to build the next enterprise killer?**
