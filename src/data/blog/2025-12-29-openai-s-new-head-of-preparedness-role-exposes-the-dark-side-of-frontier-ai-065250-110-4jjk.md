> OpenAI is hiring a 'Head of Preparedness' to fight AI-fueled cyberattacks and bio-threats—because the risks are now real.

Amid whispers of state-sponsored hackers weaponizing AI for espionage and breaches, OpenAI just posted for a 'Head of Preparedness'[1]. This isn't PR fluff—it's a direct response to frontier models enabling malicious cyber ops and even biosecurity nightmares. Think AI crafting zero-days or optimizing phishing at scale.

For developers building on top of these models, wake-up call: Your API calls could power the next big threat. This role signals OpenAI knows the guardrails are cracking, pushing for proactive mitigation over reactive patches. If you're in security or AI infra, eyes on this—expect tighter APIs, watermarking, or usage caps soon[1].

My opinion? It's smart but late. Devs, audit your pipelines now: Are you red-teaming outputs? How do you block misuse? What's your take—paranoia or necessary?
