> Cisco forecasts $3B AI infra revenue amid hyperscaler boom, but a critical zero-day in their security gear has pentesters sweating.

Cisco just cranked up their FY2026 guidance to $3 billion in AI infrastructure revenue from hyperscalers - switching, routing, optics, and security all juiced by the AI workload explosion. If you're deploying LLMs at scale, this means more robust networking stacks to handle the flood of data.[2]

For devs like us, it's practical gold: better AI networking means faster, more reliable inference clusters without the bottlenecks killing prod apps. Cisco's rally shows Wall Street buys the thesis that AI isn't just models - it's the pipes underneath. But here's my hot take: this tailwind is real, and if you're in infra, Cisco's your new best friend for scaling AI deploys.

Twist - they're bleeding from CVE-2025-20393, a perfect 10.0 CVSS zero-day in AsyncOS email security that's already exploited in the wild and on CISA's KEV list. Internet-exposed Spam Quarantine? Patch now or regret. Honest opinion: AI hype is masking sloppy sec - use this as a reminder to layer Zero-Trust everywhere. Who's auditing their Cisco gear today?
