> Google unveils Nano Banana Pro, a state-of-the-art AI model for high-quality image generation and editing with natural language.

Google has announced Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), an advanced AI image generation and editing model that builds upon the success of its earlier Nano Banana release. Nano Banana Pro is designed to support complex compositions and provide visually sophisticated results, enabling users to visualize ideas from prototypes to infographics and to convert handwritten notes into diagrams. This new model enhances productivity and creativity by making image editing more accessible through natural language commands.

Alongside this release, the industry benchmark landscape has shifted, with new MLCommons benchmarks replacing older models like BERT and Stable Diffusion v2 to better represent state-of-the-art generative AI tasks. The adoption of Nano Banana Pro reflects a broader trend toward increasingly capable AI tools that integrate visual creativity and natural language processing, demonstrating the accelerating pace of innovation in generative AI technologies.
