> FlameGuard uses LLMs and ML for real-time, high-accuracy detection and management of agricultural fires in Saudi Arabia.

FlameGuard is an AI-driven smart map system designed for early detection and management of agricultural fires, recently deployed in Saudi Arabia. The framework integrates machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost with deep learning approaches, including transformer-based LLMs adapted for geospatial prediction tasks. FlameGuard achieves 99% accuracy with sub-hour detection latency, outperforming existing systems like NASA’s FIRMS and MODIS fire alerts, which have lower accuracy and longer response times.

The system’s real-time inference and efficient training make it highly reliable for rapid fire response. By leveraging LLMs beyond natural language processing, FlameGuard demonstrates the versatility of AI in solving critical real-world problems. The use of IoT-ground-truth validation further enhances its reliability, making it a robust solution for agricultural fire management. This application highlights the growing role of AI in environmental monitoring and disaster response, showcasing how advanced models can be adapted to address pressing global challenges.
