> Nvidia's eyeing a $3B buyout of AI21 Labs – not for models, but their 200 PhD brains. Chip king goes full stack?

Nvidia, the GPU overlord, is in deep talks to snag Israeli AI21 Labs for $2-3B – a steal from their $1.4B valuation. Founders built enterprise LLMs and gen AI; Nvidia wants the 200-person dream team of AI wizards, including Mobileye's CEO.[4]

This fits Nvidia's pivot beyond silicon: licensing Groq inference, now talent raids for software muscle. In a deal frenzy (SoftBank's $4B play), it's about securing brains for the AI arms race. Stock's up 40% in 2025 – market loves it.[4]

Opinion: Smart if you're Nvidia – hardware alone won't cut it forever. But $3B premium? Risky if talent jumps ship. Devs, does this mean more open tools from Nvidia or locked ecosystems? Would you join a fresh acquisition? Spill.
