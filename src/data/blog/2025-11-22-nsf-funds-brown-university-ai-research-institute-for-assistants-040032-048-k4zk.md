> NSF grants $20M to Brown-led institute to develop trustworthy, context-aware AI assistants, focusing on mental health applications.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded a five-year, $20 million grant to Brown University to establish the AI Research Institute on Interaction for AI Assistants (ARIA). Led by computer science professor Ellie Pavlick, the multi-institution project aims to develop a new generation of AI assistants that are trustworthy, sensitive, and context-aware in their interactions with people. A key focus area for the research is mental and behavioral health, where the need for reliable and safe AI is rapidly growing.

The ARIA institute will explore advanced techniques to ensure AI assistants can understand and respond appropriately to human needs, particularly in sensitive contexts like mental health support. By prioritizing trustworthiness and safety, the project seeks to address some of the most pressing challenges in AI deployment, especially in areas where human well-being is at stake. The research could lead to significant improvements in how AI assistants interact with users, making them more effective and reliable in real-world applications.
