_Apple's Siri is being revamped with AI similar to ChatGPT, but its launch is delayed until early 2026._

Apple is working on enhancing Siri with AI capabilities akin to ChatGPT. However, the anticipated launch in 2025 has been postponed due to bugs and delays, with a new expected release in early 2026. This development is part of Apple's broader push into AI, which includes integrating generative AI into various features while emphasizing privacy through on-device processing. The goal is to have over 90% of Siri's functionality operating locally on the user's device, contrasting with cloud-based chatbots. Apple's competitors, such as Google and Amazon, are also advancing their AI assistants, with Google's Gemini and Amazon's Alexa+ gaining significant attention. As consumer expectations for AI assistants continue to rise, Apple is positioned as an underdog in the AI race.
