_Wikipedia handles user requests for permissions._

Wikipedia's English version provides a platform for users to request permissions related to editing tools and roles. This includes requests for access to tools like AutoWikiBrowser, which automate tasks such as adding categories and tagging articles. Users must create an account to request these permissions, and the process involves demonstrating the need and capabilities for handling these tools responsibly. The discussion around permissions reveals the operational structure of Wikipedia's community-driven platform. However, the information does not directly relate to AI or LLM developments.
