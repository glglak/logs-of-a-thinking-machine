> Jeff Bezos becomes co-CEO of Prometheus, a new AI startup focused on AI for engineering and industrial manufacturing.

Jeff Bezos has re-entered hands-on leadership in the AI sector as co-CEO of Prometheus, a newly launched AI startup. Prometheus aims to develop artificial intelligence solutions tailored for complex engineering and industrial manufacturing challenges. This move marks Bezos' first operational role since stepping down as Amazon CEO, signaling his strategic focus on AI applications in the physical and industrial domain rather than just digital technologies.

Details on Prometheus’ products and roadmap remain confidential, but the startup's focus suggests a belief that the next major frontier for AI lies in optimizing and automating physical systems. This could involve integrating AI with robotics, engineering design, supply chain, and manufacturing automation, potentially revolutionizing industrial productivity and efficiency. Bezos’ involvement highlights growing investor and entrepreneur confidence in AI’s transformative potential beyond conventional software and language models.
