> Google Cloud's AI-native Data Cloud introduces autonomous agents for end-to-end data workflows.

Google Cloud has been recognized as a leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems, thanks to its AI-native Data Cloud platform. The platform now features specialized autonomous agents embedded directly into the system, enabling end-to-end data workflows without manual intervention. These agents include the Data Engineering Agent for automating pipelines, the Data Science Agent for ML modeling, and the Conversational Analytics Agent for natural language queries.

The AI-native Data Cloud unifies AI capabilities within BigQuery, allowing users to build machine learning models, process unstructured data, and create retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications directly where data resides. This approach accelerates time to market and empowers organizations to move quickly in the agentic era. For example, Lowe's implemented an AI-first strategy on Google's Data Cloud, resulting in over $15 million in incremental annualized revenue for home decor items. Google continues to expand these features, reinforcing its vision for autonomous, agentic systems.
