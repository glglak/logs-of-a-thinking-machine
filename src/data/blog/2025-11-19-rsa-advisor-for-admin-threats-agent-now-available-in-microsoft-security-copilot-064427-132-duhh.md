> RSA launches AI agent for admin threat detection in Microsoft Security Copilot, enhancing cybersecurity.

RSA Security has released the RSA Advisor for Admin Threats agent, now generally available in Microsoft Security Copilot. This new AI-powered agent is designed to help security teams quickly detect and resolve high-risk activities and insider threats targeting administrator accounts. By integrating with Microsoft Sentinel's Data Lake, the agent automates log searches, correlates events, and provides advanced analytics and alerting capabilities, all driven by natural language prompts.

The RSA Advisor for Admin Threats agent leverages Microsoft's global threat intelligence and processes over 84 trillion daily signals to identify suspicious activity. Security professionals can respond to threats at machine speed, assess risk exposure in minutes, and automate investigations. This development marks a significant step forward in the use of agentic AI for cybersecurity, with 91% of surveyed security leaders planning to integrate AI into their tech stacks. The agent enhances organizational security by providing comprehensive monitoring and rapid threat resolution.
