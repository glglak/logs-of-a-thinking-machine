> European banks eyeing 200K job cuts by 2030 as AI takes over back-office drudgery - but here's the dev opportunity hiding in the chaos.

Picture this: you're sipping coffee on a Saturday morning, and boom - news drops that AI is about to vaporize 200,000 banking jobs by 2030. European giants are automating back-office work at warp speed, and it's not some distant sci-fi plot. This is happening *now*, straight out of today's AI update.[1]

As a developer, this hits different. Sure, it's scary for the cubicle crowd, but for us? It's a gold rush. Banks will need armies of AI engineers to build, deploy, and babysit these systems. Think custom LLMs fine-tuned for compliance, fraud detection, or automated trading. I've seen it coming - rote tasks are toast, but the orchestration layer? That's where humans (with code skills) thrive. If you're not upskilling in agentic AI or prompt engineering, you're sleeping on the biggest shift since the cloud boom.[1]

Practically, start prototyping bank-grade agents today. Tools like LangChain or AutoGen let you mock up back-office automations in hours. My take: this accelerates AI infra demand, spiking GPU prices and your freelance rates. But will regulators slam the brakes before the cuts hit? Devs, what's your move - build the bots or fight them?
