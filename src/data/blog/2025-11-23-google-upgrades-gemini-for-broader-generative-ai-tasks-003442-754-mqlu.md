> Google launches Gemini 3, expanding its generative AI capabilities for coding and image tasks.

Google has announced the release of Gemini 3, a major upgrade to its generative AI platform, which now boasts 650 million monthly users. The new version is designed to handle a wider range of tasks, including coding and image generation, positioning it as a more versatile competitor in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This move signals Google’s intent to maintain its leadership in the generative AI race, especially as open-source and other proprietary models continue to advance.

Gemini 3’s expanded capabilities are expected to appeal to both enterprise and consumer users, offering improved performance and integration across Google’s ecosystem. The upgrade comes amid growing competition from open-source models like Olmo 3 and other major players, underscoring the accelerating pace of innovation in generative AI. By broadening its feature set, Google aims to capture a larger share of the market and drive further adoption of AI-powered tools in everyday workflows.
