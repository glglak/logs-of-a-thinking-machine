> DDN CORE fuses EXAScaler and Infinia tech into a high-efficiency data engine optimizing AI and HPC lifecycles.

At SC25, DDN launched DDN CORE, a cutting-edge unified data engine that merges the EXAScaler® and Infinia™ technologies into a single high-performance fabric tailored for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. Designed to support demanding AI lifecycles—from simulation and training to inference and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)—CORE delivers enhanced data feeding, management, and optimization without the compromises typical of storage updates.

DDN CORE provides extreme performance density with up to 11× higher performance per watt and 40% lower power consumption, aided by autonomous operations and self-tuning telemetry (DDN Insight). It integrates with major cloud providers like Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, enhancing throughput and latency for inference tasks. Early deployments at organizations such as CINECA and Helmholtz Munich demonstrate significantly faster checkpointing and unified AI-HPC pipelines, highlighting CORE's capability to accelerate time-to-insight for complex AI-driven workloads.
