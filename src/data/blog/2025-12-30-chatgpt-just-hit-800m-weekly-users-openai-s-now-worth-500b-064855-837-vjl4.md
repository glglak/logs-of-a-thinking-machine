![ChatGPT Just Hit 800M Weekly Users – OpenAI's Now Worth $500B?!](https://news.aibase.com/images/chatgpt-users.jpg)

> OpenAI's user explosion and sky-high valuation mean AI agents are about to eat your dev workflow – for better or worse.

Holy crap, ChatGPT now has **800 million weekly active users** – that's up from 500M in March, and OpenAI just hit a **$500 billion valuation**. Sam Altman dropped this bomb at DevDay on Dec 28, calling AI 'productivity infrastructure' we rely on daily[5]. As a dev, this isn't just hype; it's your cue that building on OpenAI's platform could be the next iOS gold rush.

They're pushing hard into **AI agents** with new dev tools for interactive apps inside ChatGPT, plus wild stuff like Sora video social networks and agent-powered e-commerce with Stripe. Imagine agents handling product picks, comparisons, and payments autonomously – that's the future of apps you're building today[5]. OpenAI's betting big on ecosystem lock-in, turning models into platforms where devs like us create the real value.

My take? This shifts competition from raw model power to who controls the agents. If you're not experimenting with OpenAI's agent tools yet, start now – but watch for platform risks. What's your first agent project gonna automate?
