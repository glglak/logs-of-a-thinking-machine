> Nvidia licensing Groq's tech for AI chips while pouring billions into infra - the AI arms race just got wilder.

Picture this: Nvidia, the AI GPU king, just licensed cutting-edge tech from hot startup Groq to juice up its chips. Meanwhile, OpenAI and others are dumping billions into AI infrastructure as demand explodes.[2] If you're a dev training LLMs, this means faster inference and cheaper runs coming soon.

As someone who's optimized models on NVIDIA hardware, Groq's LPUs (language processing units) are insane for speed - think 10x faster than GPUs for certain workloads. Nvidia grabbing this tech? It's them staying ahead while the infra boom (OpenAI's billions included) floods us with capacity.[2]

Honest opinion: This validates Groq as a real player, but expect NVIDIA to dominate anyway. Practical tip: Test Groq's cloud now before prices spike. What's your go-to for inference - GPUs or challengers?
