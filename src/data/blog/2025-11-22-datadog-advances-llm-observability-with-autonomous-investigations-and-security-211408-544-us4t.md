> Datadog launches LLM observability tools to automate issue diagnosis and prevent prompt injection attacks.

Datadog has introduced new capabilities in AI Observability focused on large language models, including LLM experiments, playgrounds, and autonomous investigations designed to reduce manual work in troubleshooting AI-driven applications and infrastructure. Their Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables autonomous agents to fetch data from various sources, enhancing root cause analysis for LLM operations. Early integration partners such as Cursor, OpenAI, and Anthropic have begun trials. Additionally, Datadog has enhanced security by deploying prompt injection protection, which guards against attacks that flood models with malicious input to degrade output quality, and data poisoning prevention to protect training data integrity against adversarial manipulation. These advances mark a push toward enterprise-grade AI observability that facilitates safer, more reliable deployment of LLM-powered services, addressing core operational and security challenges in the increasingly complex AI ecosystem.[3]
