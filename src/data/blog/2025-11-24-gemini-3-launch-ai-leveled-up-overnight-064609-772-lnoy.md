> Google's Gemini 3 sets new benchmarks, but shows quirks with real-time data.

Google's Gemini 3, launched in November 2025, is the most advanced foundation model to date, topping the LMArena leaderboard with an Elo score of 1501 and outperforming GPT-5 Pro on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark. The model brings massive improvements in reasoning and multimodal capabilities, making it a leader in both general and specialized tasks. However, Gemini 3 has exposed a critical flaw: its inability to process real-time temporal shifts. When asked about 2025, the model rejected the year as fabricated, highlighting a systemic issue in LLM architecture where static training data up to 2024 prevents reliable handling of current events. This 'temporal shock' underscores the urgent need for dynamic data verification tools in next-generation AI systems.

Gemini 3's launch also introduces generative UI features, allowing dynamic, tailored user interfaces on the fly. This means search queries can yield answers in magazine formats or with embedded code widgets, such as mortgage calculators. The generative UI approach is a first step toward fully AI-generated user experiences, where interfaces adapt to user needs rather than relying on pre-built templates. This could revolutionize enterprise software, but also raises concerns about reliability and context drift in time-sensitive applications.
