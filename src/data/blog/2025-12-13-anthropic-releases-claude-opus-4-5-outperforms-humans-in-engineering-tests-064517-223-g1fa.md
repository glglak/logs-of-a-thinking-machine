> Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 beats all human candidates in internal engineering tests, escalating the AI capability race with Gemini 3 and others.

Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.5 in early December 2025, achieving a new benchmark by outperforming all human job candidates in the company's internal engineering evaluations. This release, highlighted in a December 4 HumAI digest, sets a record in AI capabilities and intensifies pressure in the 'AI capability race' following launches like Google's Gemini 3, Nano Banana Pro, and Flux 2.

The model's superior performance reframes expectations for top-tier LLMs, challenging regulators, governments, and companies to adapt to accelerating advancements. It contributes to a flurry of December model releases, driving faster innovation cycles across major labs.
